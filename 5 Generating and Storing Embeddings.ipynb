The information contained in this document is only for demonstration purposes and does not reflect the opinions or beliefs of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability or availability with respect to the information contained in this document.\nAll rights reserved to Microsoft\nSummary of Benefits\nNorthwind Health Plus\nNorthwind Health Plus is a comprehensive plan that provides comprehensive coverage for medical, vision, and dental services. This plan also offers prescription drug coverage, mental health and substance abuse coverage, and coverage for preventive care services. With Northwind Health Plus, you can choose from a variety of in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This plan also offers coverage for emergency services, both in-network and out-of-network.\nSUMMARY OF YOUR COSTS SUMMARY OF YOUR COSTS\nAt Northwind Health, we understand that health care costs can be a burden. That’s why we offer a comprehensive plan that covers the cost of medical, vision, and dental services. With Northwind Health Plus, you can choose from a variety of in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This plan also offers coverage for emergency services, both in-network and out-of-network.\nYour cost for Northwind Health Plus will depend on your plan type, the services you use, and the providers you visit. You can find more information about cost-sharing arrangements on the Northwind Health website.\nIn-Network Costs: If you use an in-network provider, your out-of-pocket costs will be lower than if you use an out-of-network provider. This is because Northwind Health has negotiated discounted rates with in-network providers.\nOut-of-Network Costs: If you use an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for paying the full cost of the services you receive. Additionally, you may have to pay a higher deductible and coinsurance.\nPrescription Drug Costs: Prescription drug costs are also taken into consideration with Northwind Health Plus. Your out-of-pocket costs will depend on the tier of the medication you are prescribed. Generally, brand-name and non-preferred generic medications will have higher out-of-pocket costs than preferred generic and generic medications.\nMental Health and Substance Abuse Coverage: Northwind Health Plus also provides coverage for mental health and substance abuse services. Generally, coverage for mental health and substance abuse services will be the same as coverage for medical and surgical services.\nPreventive Care Services: Northwind Health Plus also covers preventive care services such as immunizations and screenings. Generally, these services are covered at no cost to you. However, you will be responsible for any applicable deductibles and coinsurance.\nTips:\n• Make sure to double-check if a provider is in-network or out-of-network before you receive care. This will help you avoid any surprise costs.\n• Take advantage of preventive care services when they are offered. These services are covered at no cost to you and can help you stay healthy.\n• Be aware of your plan’s formulary, which is a list of medications that are covered by your plan. If you are prescribed a medication that is not on the formulary, you may have to pay more out-of-pocket.\n• If you have any questions about your costs, you can contact Northwind Health for more information.\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS\nIn-Network Providers HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS\nChoosing the right provider is an important part of getting the most value out of your health insurance plan.

is an essential part of getting the most value out of your plan.\nIn-Network Providers\nWhen choosing an in-network provider for your health care needs, make sure to check with Northwind Health Plus to ensure that the provider is in-network.

Northwind Health Plus offers a wide range of in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies.

In addition, Northwind Health Plus may offer additional discounts or cost-savings for using in-network providers.\nEmergency Services\nIn the event of an emergency, you can receive care from both in-network and out-of- network providers. However, if you choose to receive care from an out-of-network provider, your out-of-pocket costs may be higher. Therefore, it is important to consider the cost of out-of-network care when deciding whether to seek emergency care.\nTips for Choosing an In-Network Provider\nWhen choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind:\n• Check with Northwind Health Plus to make sure that the provider you are considering is in-network.\n• Use the searchable directory on the Northwind Health Plus website to find in-network providers in your area.\n• Ask your current provider if they are part of the Northwind Health Plus network.\n• Consider the cost savings associated with in-network providers when making your decision.\n• Consider the quality of care when choosing a provider.\n• Make sure the provider is familiar with your health insurance plan and its coverage.\n• Make sure the provider is available and can accommodate your schedule.\nConclusion\nChoosing the right provider is an important part of getting the most value out of your health insurance plan. Northwind Health Plus offers an extensive network of in-network providers that can help you save money on health care services. By following the tips outlined above, you can make sure that you are choosing an in-network provider that is most convenient and cost-effective for you and your family.\nContinuity of Care\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Continuity of Care\nIt’s important to understand continuity of care when selecting a provider. Continuity of care is the process of being treated by the same provider or medical team over a period of time. When you have continuity of care, your provider has a better understanding of your medical history, enabling them to provide more accurate diagnoses and treatments.\nContinuity of care is important when selecting a provider because it ensures better quality of care. When you have continuity of care, your provider is more familiar with your medical history, which can lead to more effective treatments. Also, if you stay with the same provider for a period of time, the provider will be more likely to know about any changes in your health and can offer more personalized care.\nThe Northwind Health Plus plan offers coverage for continuity of care.

provider. Additionally, if you are switching from an in-network provider to an out-of- network provider, you may be required to switch to an in-network provider.\nWhen selecting a provider, it’s important to keep continuity of care in mind. Here are a few tips that can help you ensure continuity of care:\n• Always check your provider’s network status before scheduling an appointment.\n• If you’re switching to a new provider, make sure they are in-network.\n• Ask your provider if they offer continuity of care.\n• If you are switching to a new provider, make sure they are familiar with your medical history.\n• If you are switching from an in-network provider to an out-of-network provider, make sure you understand what that means for your coverage.\n• Make sure you keep all of your medical records up to date.\nContinuity of care is an important factor to consider when selecting a provider. Northwind Health Plus offers coverage for continuity of care, so you may be able to continue seeing the same provider without having to switch to a different provider in the network. However, there are some exceptions to the continuity of care rule, so it’s important to understand what those are. By following these tips, you can ensure you have the best possible coverage and ensure continuity of care.\nNon-Participating\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS\nWhen it comes to health care, the provider you choose can have a major impact on your costs. With Northwind Health Plus, you have the option to choose from a variety of in- network providers. However, if you choose to go outside of the network, you may incur additional costs.\nNon-Participating Providers\nNon-participating providers are providers that are not in-network with Northwind Health Plus. When you visit a provider that is not in-network, you will be responsible for the entire cost of the care. This means that, if you choose to visit a provider who is not in-network, you will have to pay the entire cost of the service out-of-pocket.\nExceptions\nThere are some exceptions to this rule. If you are traveling outside of the United States and you cannot find an in-network provider, you may be able to visit a non-participating provider and Northwind Health Plus may cover a portion of the cost. Additionally, if you are in a life-threatening situation and need to go to the nearest hospital, Northwind Health Plus may provide coverage for the care received.\nTips\nIf you are considering visiting a provider that is not in-network, it is important to check with Northwind Health Plus first. Before your visit, contact the customer service line to find out if the provider is in-network and if there are any exceptions that could apply to your situation. Additionally, it is important to review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) after your visit to ensure that you are not being charged for any services that were not covered by your insurance. If you are charged for a service that was not covered, contact Northwind Health Plus right away.\nIf you are considering a new provider, it is important to ask if they are in-network with Northwind Health Plus. This can save you time and money in the long run. Additionally, you can use Northwind Health Plus’s online provider directory to search for a provider that is in-network and view their ratings.\nBy understanding the difference between in-network and non-participating providers and being aware of any exceptions that may apply to you, you can save money on your health care costs. Northwind Health Plus is here to help you make the most of your coverage.

This means that you may be responsible for paying the entire cost of the services, minus any applicable discounts. It is important to keep in mind that you may also be subject to balance billing from an out-of-network provider.

will cover the same amount as if the care was provided by an in-network provider.\nWhen considering care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to understand the potential risks of doing so. You may end up paying more out of pocket because the provider is not contracted with Northwind Health Plus, or you may be subject to balance billing.\nIt is important to do your research before seeking care from an out-of-network provider. Make sure to ask questions about the provider’s billing policies, cost of services, and any potential discounts. It is also important to call Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving care to make sure that the services are covered and to understand your financial responsibility.\nTips for seeking out-of-network care:\n• Ask the provider if they accept Northwind Health Plus and if they will accept the amount paid by the plan.\n• Ask the provider what their billing policies are and if they offer any discounts.\n• Ask Northwind Health Plus if the services are covered and if there are any limits or exclusions.\n• Ask Northwind Health Plus if you will be subject to balance billing.\n• Check to see if there is an in-network provider available that offers the same services.\nBy taking the time to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network care and by doing your research, you can make sure that you are making the best decisions for your health and your wallet.\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS\nWhen it comes to healthcare, one of the most important decisions you can make is choosing the right provider. With Northwind Health Plus, you can select from a wide range of in- network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This plan also covers emergency services, both in-network and out-of-network.\nThe provider you choose will have a direct impact on your costs. When you use in-network providers, you’ll pay lower out-of-pocket costs. On the other hand, if you use out-of-network providers, you’ll be responsible for a larger portion of the cost. In some cases, you may be responsible for the entire cost.\nIt is important to note that in-network providers are not necessarily the same across all plans. So, even if a provider is in-network for one plan, they may not be in-network for another. Therefore, it’s important to check if your preferred provider is in-network before you select a plan.\nWhen selecting a provider, there are a few tips you should keep in mind:\n• Research your provider’s credentials. Make sure they are properly licensed and accredited.\n• Ask about their experience. How long have they been in practice? What kind of patients have they treated in the past?\n• Ask about their methods. Do they use evidence-based treatments? Are they up-to-date on the latest medical advancements?\n• Ask about their services. Do they offer preventive care services? What about mental health and substance abuse services?\n• Ask about their costs. Do they offer payment plans or discounts? How do they compare to other providers in terms of cost?\n• Ask about their availability. Are they available to answer questions or provide guidance when needed?\n• Check reviews. Read reviews from past patients to get a better idea of their experience.\nBy taking the time to research your provider, you can ensure that you’re getting the best care possible at the lowest cost.\nThere are also a few exceptions to be aware of. For example, Northwind Health Plus does not cover elective or cosmetic procedures. Additionally, some services are only covered when they are performed by in-network providers.

getting the best care possible at the lowest cost. With Northwind Health Plus, you can rest assured that you’re getting quality coverage for all your healthcare needs.\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION\nCopayments (Copays)\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays)\nWhen using Northwind Health Plus, you may be responsible for a copayment (or copay) for certain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you are expected to pay for a service. The amount of the copayment varies based on the type of service received, whether the service is rendered by an in-network or out-of-network provider, and other factors.\nIn-Network Copays:\nFor in-network services, copayments are generally lower than for out-of-network services. The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $20, while specialist visits have a copayment of around $50. For in-network emergency services, the copayment is typically around $100. In addition, for in-network preventive care services, there is typically no copayment.\nOut-of-Network Copays:\nFor out-of-network services, copayments are typically higher than for in-network services. The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $50, while specialist visits have a copayment of around $75. For out-of-network emergency services, the copayment is typically around $150. Please note that Northwind Health Plus will only cover a portion of out-of-network services, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance.\nExceptions:\nThere are a few exceptions to the copayment amounts listed above. For example, for mental health and substance abuse services, the copayment for in-network services is typically around $30 and the copayment for out-of-network services is typically around $60. In addition, the copayment for preventive care services is typically waived if received from an in-network provider.\nTips:\nIt is important to remember that copayments are subject to change and may vary depending on the type of service received. It is also important to note that copayments are not waived for out-of-network services, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance after Northwind Health Plus has paid its portion.\nFinally, it is important to make sure that the provider you are seeing is in-network. This can be easily done by checking the provider directory on the Northwind Health Plus website. It is also important to remember that if you receive a service from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for a higher copayment.\nBy understanding and following these tips, you can be sure to get the most out of your Northwind Health Plus coverage and avoid unnecessary copayments.\nSplit Copay For Office Visits\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Split Copay For Office Visits\nNorthwind Health Plus offers a split copay for office visits in order to make healthcare more affordable for its members. This means that you will pay a lower copay for office visits than you would for other services. The split copay is applied to office visits with primary care physicians, specialists, and mental health providers.\nOffice visits with primary care physicians are subject to a $35 copay. Office visits with specialists are subject to a $60 copay. Mental health visits with a psychiatrist or another mental health provider are subject to a $45 copay.\nThere are a few exceptions to this split copay. Emergency room visits and urgent care visits are not subject to the split copay and will be subject to the full copay amount that applies to the type of provider that you visited. Office visits with an anesthesiologist are also not subject to the split copay and will be subject to the full copay amount that applies to the type of provider that you visited.\nWhen visiting your doctor, it is important to understand which type of provider you are visiting.

on your insurance card.\nWhen you visit a doctor, you should also inform the office staff that you are a Northwind Health Plus member. This will ensure that the staff bills your insurance correctly and that you are charged the correct amount for your copay.\nIf you have any questions about your copay amount, you can contact Northwind Health's customer service team. They will be able to provide more detailed information about your coverage and copay amount.\nIt is important to remember that the split copay only applies to office visits. Other services, such as lab tests, X-rays, and imaging tests, are subject to different copay amounts, which are listed on your insurance card.\nIt is also important to remember that the split copay only applies to in-network providers. If you visit an out-of-network provider, you will be subject to a higher copay amount, which is also listed on your insurance card.\nAt Northwind Health Plus, we are committed to helping our members get the care they need at a price they can afford. With the split copay for office visits, we hope to make healthcare more affordable for you and your family.\nCalendar Year Deductible\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Calendar Year Deductible\nThe Northwind Health Plus plan has a calendar year deductible that applies to some services. The amount you must pay out-of-pocket before the plan begins to pay for covered services is called the calendar year deductible. The calendar year deductible is the same for all members of the plan and is reset each year on the plan's renewal date.\nFor In-Network Services: The calendar year deductible for in-network services is $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families. This means that you must pay the full cost of all covered services until you have paid a total of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. Once this amount is reached, the plan will begin to pay its share of the cost of eligible services.\nFor Out-of-Network Services: The plan does not have a calendar year deductible for out-of- network services. However, out-of-network services are subject to higher cost sharing than in-network services, so be sure to check with your provider to find out the cost sharing that applies.\nExceptions: Certain services are exempt from the calendar year deductible. These services include preventive care services and emergency services.\nTips:\n• Be sure to check with your provider to find out if a service is subject to the calendar year deductible before receiving the service.\n• Make sure you understand the cost sharing that applies to out-of-network services.\n• Be aware that the calendar year deductible is reset each year on the plan’s renewal date.\n• Remember that preventive care services and emergency services are exempt from the calendar year deductible.\nCoinsurance\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance\nCoinsurance is a cost-sharing requirement under Northwind Health Plus. This means that after you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for a certain percentage of the costs for covered services. The coinsurance rate is usually a percentage of the allowed amount for a service, and it is your responsibility to pay this amount.\nFor example, if the allowed amount for a service is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%, you are responsible for paying $20 (20% of $100). The insurance company will pay the remaining amount of $80.\nCoinsurance may apply to all services, including hospitalization, emergency room visits, preventive care, and some mental health and substance abuse services. However, coinsurance does not apply to some services, such as preventive care services.\nIt is important to understand the amount of coinsurance you are responsible for.

responsible for paying. If you have met all of your deductibles and coinsurance requirements, the plan will pay the remaining costs.\nTips for Using Your Coinsurance:\n1. Review your plan documents to understand the coinsurance rates for all services you may need. This will help you budget for any services you may need in the future and be better prepared for the cost.\n2. Consider using in-network providers when possible. Many plans offer lower coinsurance rates for in-network providers, meaning you will pay less for the same service.\n3. Ask your provider for an estimate of the cost of a service before you receive it. This will help you determine how much of the cost you will be responsible for.\n4. Keep track of the services you receive and the amount you pay. This will help you understand how much you have paid towards your coinsurance requirement for the year.\n5. Contact your plan administrator if you have any questions about your coinsurance requirement or what services are subject to coinsurance.\nOut-Of-Pocket Maximum\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Out-Of-Pocket Maximum\nUnder the Northwind Health Plus plan, members are responsible for costs associated with their health care. These costs can include deductibles, copays, coinsurance, and other out of pocket expenses. To help members manage health care costs, the Northwind Health Plus plan offers a maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) limit. Once a member has reached the OOP limit, they pay no more out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the plan year.\nUnderstanding the Out-of-Pocket Maximum\nThe Northwind Health Plus plan’s out-of-pocket maximum includes deductibles, copays, coinsurance, and other out-of-pocket expenses. This amount does not include premiums, balance-billed charges, or charges for non-covered services. The OOP maximum resets at the start of each plan year, meaning members have to start from scratch when the new plan year begins.\nThe OOP maximum applies to all services, including in-network and out-of-network services, except for non-covered services, balance-billed charges, and premium payments. This means that all in-network services and out-of-network services count towards the OOP maximum.\nExceptions\nThere are a few exceptions to the OOP maximum. For example, if a member seeks services from a provider that is not in-network, they may be balance-billed for the difference between what the provider charges and what Northwind Health Plus allows. Balance-billed charges do not count towards the OOP maximum.\nAnother exception is non-covered services. If a member receives a service that is not covered by the plan, they may be responsible for paying the full cost of the service. These services also do not count towards the OOP maximum.\nTips for Reaching the Out-of-Pocket Maximum\nReaching the OOP maximum can be a challenge, but there are a few tips that can help members get there.\nFirst, it’s important to understand what services are covered by the plan and which are not. Northwind Health Plus covers a wide range of services, including preventive care, primary care, and specialty care. It’s important to know which services are covered and which are not so members can make the most of their coverage.\nSecond, it’s important to stay in-network as much as possible. Staying in-network helps members get the most out of their coverage and saves them money. In-network providers typically charge lower rates and provide a higher level of care than out-of-network providers.\nThird, it’s important to understand the difference between deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. Deductibles are the amount a member has to pay before the plan starts paying, copays are a set fee for services, and coinsurance is the percentage of the cost a member has to pay.

stay healthy and avoid costly treatments and services down the road.\nReaching the out-of-pocket maximum can be a challenge, but with the right knowledge and tips, members can take advantage of their Northwind Health Plus plan and get the most out of their coverage.\nAllowed Amount\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Allowed Amount\nWhen receiving services under Northwind Health Plus, you are responsible for paying a portion of the cost of care. The portion of the cost that you are required to pay is known as the Allowed Amount. The Allowed Amount is the amount that the plan will pay towards the cost of care. The Allowed Amount may vary depending on the type of care received.\nFor example, if you receive services from an in-network provider, the Allowed Amount may be lower than if you receive services from an out-of-network provider. The Allowed Amount also may vary depending on the type of service received. In general, preventive services such as physicals, immunizations, and screenings have lower Allowed Amounts than other types of care.\nYou should always check with the provider prior to receiving services to determine the Allowed Amount that Northwind Health Plus will pay for the services you are receiving. This way, you will know what your financial responsibility will be and can plan accordingly.\nWhen you receive services from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay the full Allowed Amount up front. You then can submit a claim to Northwind Health Plus for reimbursement of the Allowed Amount less any applicable copays, coinsurance, or deductibles.\nIn some cases, Northwind Health Plus may not cover services that are considered experimental or investigational. If a service is not covered, you may be responsible for the entire cost of the service. Therefore, it is important to check with Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving services to determine if a service is covered.\nIn addition, some services may be subject to pre-authorization or pre-certification. This means that you must obtain approval from Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving the service. If pre-authorization or pre-certification is not obtained, you may be responsible for the full cost of the services.\nIt is important to understand that the Allowed Amount does not include any applicable copays, coinsurance, or deductibles that may be due. It is also important to understand that the Allowed Amount may vary depending on the type of care received and the type of provider that is providing the care. Therefore, it is important to check with the provider prior to receiving services to determine the Allowed Amount that Northwind Health Plus will pay for the services you are receiving.\nFinally, it is important to keep track of your out-of-pocket expenses. This includes any copays, coinsurance, or deductibles that you may be required to pay. It is important to understand what your financial responsibility is when receiving care under Northwind Health Plus, so that you can plan accordingly and make sure that you are meeting your financial obligations.\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION\nNorthwind Health Plus is a comprehensive health plan that offers coverage for medical, vision, and dental services. It also provides coverage for prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse services, and preventive care. You can choose from a variety of in- network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. Emergency services are also covered, both in-network and out-of-network.\nCo-pays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums may apply to your plan. Your plan may also include separate deductibles for different services, such as prescription drugs and hospitalization.

in the plan. For instance, some plans may not cover certain types of services, such as cosmetic procedures, or they may have limits on the number of visits to a provider that are covered. It is important to read through your plan to understand what is and isn’t covered.\nWhen you are using your Northwind Health Plus plan, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, remember to bring your Northwind Health Plus ID card with you when you go to the doctor or pharmacy. This will help the provider verify your coverage and process your claims. Second, if you are prescribed a medication, check to make sure it is covered by your plan. You may be able to save money by using a generic version of the drug or by using a mail-order pharmacy.\nFinally, if you are seeing an out-of-network provider, remember that you may be responsible for paying more out-of-pocket costs than you would for an in-network provider. Make sure to check with the provider to get an estimate of what your costs will be.\nBy understanding the plan and its exceptions and limitations, and by following these tips, you can make sure you are getting the most out of your Northwind Health Plus plan.\nCOVERED SERVICES\nAcupuncture\nCOVERED SERVICES: Acupuncture\nAcupuncture is an ancient form of healing that has been practiced in China for thousands of years. It involves the use of very thin needles inserted into specific points in the body to stimulate energy flow and promote physical and emotional balance. Northwind Health Plus covers acupuncture services, including both in-network and out-of-network acupuncture providers.\nWhen using an in-network acupuncture provider, coverage is provided for up to 12 visits per year. Each visit must be medically necessary and approved by your primary care physician. All acupuncture services must be performed by an appropriately licensed acupuncturist, and acupuncture services are limited to one hour per visit.\nWhen using an out-of-network acupuncture provider, Northwind Health Plus covers up to $25 per visit, after the deductible has been met. Out-of-network acupuncture services must also be medically necessary and approved by your primary care physician. All acupuncture services must be performed by an appropriately licensed acupuncturist and services are limited to one hour per visit.\nWhen you visit an acupuncture provider, be sure to bring your Northwind Health Plus insurance card and a form of payment for the office visit or copayment. You will also need to provide the acupuncture provider with the authorization from your primary care physician.\nBefore scheduling an acupuncture appointment, it’s important to make sure the acupuncturist is licensed and in-network with Northwind Health Plus. It’s also important to talk to your primary care physician to make sure that acupuncture is an appropriate treatment for your medical condition.\nIn addition to traditional acupuncture treatments, Northwind Health Plus also covers acupuncture-related services such as acupressure, cupping, moxibustion, and tui na. These services may be covered when provided by an appropriate acupuncturist as part of a treatment plan approved by your primary care physician.\nNorthwind Health Plus does not cover services that are experimental, investigational, or for cosmetic purposes. Services for nutritional counseling, massage therapy, and physical therapy are also not covered. Northwind Health Plus also does not cover acupuncture services that are provided in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility.\nIf you have any questions about acupuncture services covered by Northwind Health Plus, contact the Member Services department at Northwind Health.

they are medically necessary.

Services covered by this plan include:\n• Blood tests and transfusions\n• Blood typing\n• Platelet donation and collection\n• Hemoglobin testing\n• Hemophilia treatment\n• Anemia treatment\nOut-of-Network Coverage:\nNorthwind Health Plus also covers blood products and services received from out-of- network providers.

This type of treatment is done through the use of a patient’s white blood cells, which are extracted and modified to be able to recognize and attack cancer cells. These modified white blood cells are then reintroduced into the patient’s body, allowing their immune system to fight the cancer. This type of therapy is typically used to treat cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, as well as some other types of cancer.\nGene therapy is a therapeutic modality that involves the introduction of exogenous genetic material into an individual's cells for the purpose of modifying or correcting pathological gene expression patterns. This process can be accomplished through various vectors, including viral and non-viral delivery systems, with the aim of inducing therapeutic effects through the modulation of cellular processes.\nBoth of these treatments are covered under the Northwind Health Plus plan, but there are some exceptions. For example, treatments that are experimental in nature are not covered.

This coverage applies to both in-network and out-of-network providers.\nIn-Network Providers\nIf you seek emergency care from an in-network provider, your plan will cover the cost of treatment, including any necessary hospitalization and follow-up care.

If you receive services from an out-of-network provider, you may also be responsible for paying the difference between the amount billed by the provider and the amount the plan will pay.\nExceptions\nNorthwind Health Plus does not cover certain types of emergency services. These include services for certain social and cosmetic procedures, elective surgery, experimental treatments, and services for injuries or illnesses that are not medically necessary.\nTips for Employees\nIt is important to keep in mind that if you have an emergency, you should seek care from the nearest hospital or medical facility. Regardless of whether it is in-network or out-of- network, you will be covered. It is also important to remember that if you receive care from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for higher out-of-pocket costs.\nIt is also important to be aware of the exceptions to Northwind Health Plus’ coverage of emergency services. Certain services, such as those for elective surgery and experimental treatments, are not covered.\nLastly, it is important to keep your Northwind Health Plus ID card with you at all times.

Our coverage includes non-emergency medical transportation through ground transportation services, such as taxi, Uber, or Lyft.

Additionally, our coverage does not include transportation for medical appointments outside of your network, as these are not covered by Northwind Health Plus.\nHere are a few tips to help you make the most of your Medical Transportation coverage:\n• Make sure to call your Northwind Health Plus Member Services team before scheduling any medical appointments to ensure that you have access to the coverage you need.\n• Keep your Medical Transportation coverage card with you at all times, so you can easily access it when needed.\n• If you need to access Medical Transportation coverage for an emergency situation, make sure to call the Member Services team as soon as possible.\n• Before scheduling any medical transportation services, check to make sure that the provider is an in-network provider.\nAt Northwind Health Plus, we are committed to providing our members with access to quality healthcare services, including Medical Transportation coverage.

is unable to travel to their appointment by public transportation.\n• The appointment is medically necessary and is covered by Northwind Health Plus.\nIf you meet these criteria, you may be eligible to receive NEMT services. You will need to contact your provider to arrange for transportation. You will also need to inform your provider of the date, time, and location of your appointment, as well as the type of service you require.\nIt’s important to note that NEMT services are not available for all types of medical appointments. This service is only available for medically necessary services that are covered by Northwind Health Plus. Additionally, NEMT services are only available for appointments within the state you live in. For example, if you live in Delaware, you can only receive NEMT services for appointments in Delaware.\nWhen you need to arrange for transportation, make sure to contact your provider at least 72 hours in advance. This will help ensure that your transportation request is processed in time for your appointment. Additionally, be sure to have your Northwind Health Plus member ID card with you when you receive transportation services.\nFinally, it’s important to note that NEMT services are provided by a third-party provider. Northwind Health Plus is not responsible for any fees associated with NEMT services. This includes any fees charged by the transportation provider.\nAt Northwind Health Plus, we understand that transportation can be a barrier for many members. That’s why we are proud to offer NEMT services for members living in select states. With this service, you can receive the care you need without having to worry about how you’ll get there.\nMental Health Care\nCOVERED SERVICES: Mental Health Care\nAt Contoso, we understand the importance of mental health care and are proud to offer Northwind Health Plus, which provides comprehensive mental health coverage to our employees.\nNorthwind Health Plus covers a wide range of mental health services, including counseling, psychiatric visits, therapy, and group therapy. Services are provided in-network and out-of- network, with coverage for both inpatient and outpatient visits.\nIn-Network Services\nWhen receiving mental health care, it is important to make sure you are using an in- network provider. When you use an in-network provider, your out-of-pocket costs are generally lower and your coverage is more comprehensive. Northwind Health Plus offers a network of providers that are in-network, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies.\nOut-of-Network Services\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to receive mental health care from an out-of-network provider. Northwind Health Plus will still cover a portion of the cost of services received from an out-of-network provider. However, it is important to note that out-of-pocket costs are typically higher when receiving care from an out-of-network provider.\nExceptions\nNorthwind Health Plus does not cover some services related to mental health care, including long-term treatment plans, experimental treatments, and treatments related to pre-existing conditions.\nTips for Receiving Mental Health Care\nAt Contoso, we encourage our employees to prioritize their mental health and seek out the care they need. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when seeking mental health care:\n• Make sure you are using an in-network provider to access the most comprehensive coverage and the lowest out-of-pocket costs.\n•

such as our Employee Assistance Program.\nAt Contoso, we understand the importance of mental health care and are committed to supporting our employees in their journey to mental wellbeing. We encourage you to take advantage of the mental health coverage provided by Northwind Health Plus.\nNeurodevelopmental Therapy (Habilitation) Neurodevelopmental Therapy (Habilitation)\nNeurodevelopmental therapy (habilitation) is a type of service offered under the Northwind Health Plus plan that is designed to help individuals with physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities. Habilitation services focus on helping individuals develop, maintain, and improve skills and functioning in areas like communication, self-care, mobility, and social skills.\nUnder the Northwind Health Plus plan, habilitation services are covered up to a certain dollar amount and number of visits. This amount and the number of visits may vary depending on the individual’s needs. To receive coverage for habilitation services, the individual must be referred to a qualified provider by their primary care physician.\nWhen seeking habilitation services, it is important to consider the individual’s needs and goals. The provider should take this into consideration when creating a treatment plan. Some of the goals of habilitation services may include improving the individual’s ability to communicate, learning how to use adaptive equipment, improving physical coordination and strength, and developing social and behavioral skills.\nWhen seeking habilitation services, it is important to understand the different types of therapy that are available. This may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and/or behavior modification therapy. Each of these therapies has different goals and approaches. It is important to understand which type of therapy is best suited for the individual’s needs and goals.\nIt is also important to note that habilitation services are not covered for individuals under the age of 21. These services are only available for those 21 and older. Additionally, habilitation services are not covered for the treatment of mental illness or substance abuse.\nFinally, it is important to remember that habilitation services can be expensive. If an individual is not able to afford the cost of habilitation services, they may want to consider seeking assistance from a state-funded program or other organizations that provide financial assistance.\nOverall, the Northwind Health Plus plan provides comprehensive coverage for habilitation services. It is important to understand the coverage limits and exceptions for habilitation services before seeking treatment. Additionally, it is important to consider the individual’s needs and goals when choosing a type of therapy. Finally, if an individual is unable to afford the cost of habilitation services, they may want to explore other options for financial assistance.\nNewborn Care COVERED SERVICES: Newborn Care\nAt Northwind Health, we understand that bringing a new life into the world is both exciting and overwhelming.

Jaw Augmentation or Reduction, as a covered service. This procedure is used to correct irregularities in the jaw and face caused by misalignment of bones or teeth. It is a complex procedure that involves cutting and repositioning the jaw bones to improve the alignment and overall appearance of the face.\nOrthognathic Surgery is typically covered when medically necessary and is performed to improve the functional aspects of the jaw and face. It is important to note that Northwind Health Plus will only cover this procedure when it is performed by a physician who is a member of the Northwind Health provider network.\nWhen considering Orthognathic Surgery, it is important to note that it is a major procedure and you should ask your physician any questions you may have about the operation. Additionally, you should discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure with your physician to make sure it is the right decision for you.\nBefore undergoing Orthognathic Surgery, you may need to have certain tests and evaluations performed, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and physical exams. In some cases, you may need to be referred to a specialist for a more in-depth evaluation.\nIn some cases, Northwind Health Plus may require pre-authorization for Orthognathic Surgery prior to the procedure being performed. This means that you may need to get approval from Northwind Health Plus before the procedure can be done. Your physician can provide you with more information about this process.\nAfter the procedure, your physician may recommend that you wear a protective appliance, such as a splint or headgear, to protect your jaw while it heals. You may also need to attend follow-up appointments with your physician to monitor your progress.\nNorthwind Health Plus typically covers the cost of Orthognathic Surgery, but you should confirm with your provider that all costs associated with the procedure are covered. Additionally, you should keep in mind that there may be certain limitations or exclusions that apply to this coverage, so it is important to review your policy in detail to be sure that you understand what is and is not covered.\nIf you have any questions about Orthognathic Surgery and whether or not it is covered under your Northwind Health Plus plan, you should contact your provider for more information.\nPrescription Drug COVERED SERVICES: Prescription Drug\nNorthwind Health Plus offers comprehensive coverage for prescription drugs.

Northwind Health Plus Plan covers spinal and other manipulations. Spinal manipulation is a form of manual therapy that is used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. It is often used to treat back pain, neck pain, and headaches. Other manipulations may be used to treat conditions such as shoulder pain, hip pain, and knee pain.\nSpinal manipulations can be performed by a variety of healthcare providers, including physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopaths. These manipulations involve applying manual force to joints of the spine, hips, and other areas of the body. The goal is to reduce pain and improve mobility.\nThe Northwind Health Plus Plan covers the cost of spinal manipulations up to a certain amount each year. In addition to covering the cost of the manipulation itself, the plan also covers the cost of x-rays and other tests that may be necessary to diagnose the condition being treated. This plan also covers the cost of any supplies or equipment needed to perform the manipulation.\nHowever, the Northwind Health Plus Plan does not cover the cost of spinal manipulations performed for cosmetic reasons. It also does not cover the cost of long-term care or maintenance manipulations.\nWhen considering spinal manipulation as a treatment option, it is important to discuss the potential risks and benefits with your doctor. Your doctor can help you determine if this form of therapy is right for you and can provide you with information on the potential side effects.\nIn addition, it is important to make sure that you are working with a qualified practitioner. Check with your insurance company to make sure that the practitioner you are considering is in-network and covered by your plan. Also, make sure that the practitioner is experienced and knowledgeable in the type of manipulation that they are performing.\nFinally, keep in mind that spinal manipulations are not a substitute for medical care. If you are experiencing severe pain or other symptoms, you should seek medical attention immediately.\nBy taking the time to understand the benefits and risks of spinal and other manipulations, you can make sure that you are making an informed decision about your health care. With the Northwind Health Plus Plan, you can take advantage of the coverage provided for these services and get the treatment you need.\nSubstance Use Disorder\nSubstance Use Disorder Coverage\nAt Contoso, we are proud to offer our employees Northwind Health Plus, an insurance plan that provides comprehensive coverage for medical, vision, and dental services.

and social well-being.\nWhat is Covered under the Northwind Health Plus Plan?\nThe Northwind Health Plus plan covers a wide range of services related to the treatment of SUD. These services include inpatient and outpatient treatment, counseling, and medications to help with recovery. It also covers mental health services and support for family members of those with SUD.\nExceptions\nNot all services related to SUD are covered by the Northwind Health Plus plan. For example, the plan does not cover experimental treatments or services that are not medically necessary. It also does not cover services provided by non-network providers.\nTips for Employees\nIf you or someone you care about is struggling with SUD, there are a few things you can do to get the most out of your Northwind Health Plus plan:\n• Talk to your doctor or a mental health professional about your symptoms and the treatments that may be available.\n• Make sure you understand the coverage provided by your plan and that you receive all the services that are covered.\n• Be aware of the out-of-pocket costs associated with the services you receive.\n• Take advantage of any support services offered by the plan, such as counseling, group therapy, or family support.\n• Ask your doctor or mental health provider about medications that may be covered by your plan.\n• Reach out to family and friends for support.\n• Take steps to reduce stress in your life and find healthy ways to cope with difficult emotions.\nAt Contoso, we want to make sure our employees have the resources they need to take care of their mental and physical health.

With Northwind Health Plus, you have access to comprehensive coverage for a variety of surgeries, including inpatient and outpatient procedures. However, there are some exceptions to this coverage.\nThe first exception is that Northwind Health Plus does not cover cosmetic surgery.

This includes any form of surgery or treatment that is not medically accepted or approved by a major medical organization.\nThe third exception is that Northwind Health Plus does not cover any procedure or treatment that is not medically necessary. This includes elective or cosmetic procedures, such as breast reduction or hair removal.\nFinally, Northwind Health Plus also does not cover any procedure or treatment that is not performed by a licensed medical practitioner. This includes any procedure or treatment that is performed by an unlicensed or untrained practitioner.\nWhen it comes to surgery, it is important to understand the coverage that you have under Northwind Health Plus. It is also important to be aware of any exceptions to your coverage. If you have any questions or concerns about your coverage, it is important to contact Northwind Health Plus directly to ensure that you have the coverage you need.\nIn addition to understanding the coverage you have, it is also important to understand the risks associated with surgery.

to help relieve pain in the jaw joint.\nPhysical Therapy\nNorthwind Health Plus will cover the cost of physical therapy to help relieve the symptoms of TMJ disorders. Physical therapy may include stretching exercises, massage, and ultrasound treatments. Northwind Health Plus will also cover the cost of splints and other devices that can help reduce jaw pain and improve jaw movement.\nExceptions\nNorthwind Health Plus does not cover the cost of any treatments or procedures that are considered experimental or cosmetic. This includes treatments such as facial surgery, Botox injections, and laser treatments.\nTips\nTo help manage the symptoms of TMJ disorders, Northwind Health Plus recommends the following tips:\n• Practice good posture and body mechanics: Make sure you maintain good posture when sitting and standing, and avoid clenching your teeth or grinding them.\n• Avoid chewing gum: Chewing gum can cause your jaw muscles to become fatigued, which can worsen TMJ symptoms.\n• Avoid large meals: Eating large meals can put a strain on your jaw muscles, so try to avoid eating large meals or snacks.\n• Practice relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce jaw tension and relieve TMJ symptoms.\n• Use heat and cold therapy: Applying heat or cold to your jaw can help reduce pain and muscle tension.\n• Avoid extreme jaw movements: Avoid extreme jaw movements, such as widely opening your mouth or clenching your teeth.\nTherapeutic Injections\nCOVERED SERVICES: Therapeutic Injections\nAt Northwind Health, we understand the importance of having access to therapeutic injections that can help treat medical conditions and provide relief from pain. We are pleased to offer coverage for therapeutic injections as part of the Northwind Health Plus plan.\nTherapeutic injections are a type of procedure in which drugs or other substances are injected directly into the body to treat medical conditions and provide relief from pain. The most common types of therapeutic injections are corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation, and hyaluronic acid, which can be used to treat joint pain.\nTherapeutic injections are often used to treat a range of conditions, such as arthritis, tendonitis, bursitis, and muscle spasms. They can also be used to treat chronic pain and can help reduce inflammation and swelling. Therapeutic injections can also be used to provide relief from migraines, headaches, and other types of pain.\nUnder the Northwind Health Plus plan, therapeutic injections are covered when they are administered by a licensed healthcare professional. These injections must be medically necessary and prescribed by a physician in order to be eligible for coverage.\nIn some cases, members may be required to obtain prior authorization before receiving a therapeutic injection. This prior authorization ensures that the injection is medically necessary and that it is the most appropriate treatment for the condition.\nThe Northwind Health Plus plan does not cover experimental or investigational treatments, including injections that are not medically necessary. Members should also be aware that not all therapeutic injections are covered under the plan.\nIt is important to note that therapeutic injections can have side effects and risks, so members should always discuss these with their healthcare provider before undergoing the procedure. Members should also discuss any potential costs that may not be covered under the plan, such as the cost of the drug or any additional procedures that may be necessary.\nWhen using therapeutic injections, it is important to follow up with your healthcare provider to ensure the injection was effective and that there are no complications.

Plus plan, members can benefit from improved health and pain relief without additional costs. Members should always discuss their options with their healthcare provider and be sure to follow the instructions provided in order to ensure the best outcome.\nTransplants\nCOVERED SERVICES: Transplants\nAt Contoso, we understand the importance of providing the best coverage available to our employees. That’s why we have partnered with Northwind Health to offer our employees Northwind Health Plus coverage. Northwind Health Plus offers coverage for transplants, with some exceptions.\nTransplant coverage includes both the transplant itself, as well as associated costs such as pre- and post-transplant care, hospital stays, medications, and laboratory services. Pre- transplant testing and evaluation, including laboratory services, imaging tests, and other tests may also be covered.\nIt’s important to note that not all transplants are covered under Northwind Health Plus. For example, transplants of non-vital organs such as the gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas are not covered. Additionally, transplants of non-human organs, such as animal organs, are not covered.\nWhen considering a transplant, it’s important to be aware of the costs associated with the procedure and associated care. Northwind Health Plus helps offset the costs of most transplants, but it’s important to be aware that there may be co-pays or deductibles associated with the procedure. Additionally, there may be out-of-pocket costs for services that are not covered under Northwind Health Plus.\nIt’s also important to be aware of the eligibility criteria for transplants. Most transplants are only available to individuals who are healthy enough to tolerate the procedure and the associated recovery time. Additionally, most transplants require the individual to comply with certain medical protocols to ensure the best chance of success. For example, some transplants require the individual to undergo certain laboratory tests or to take certain medications prior to the procedure.\nIt’s also important to be aware of the potential risks associated with transplants. Potential risks include infection, organ rejection, and other issues related to the body’s response to the procedure. It’s important to discuss the potential risks with your doctor prior to undergoing the procedure.\nFinally, it’s important to be aware that the availability of transplants is limited. Transplants are only available if suitable organs and/or tissues are available. Additionally, the wait time for a transplant can vary significantly based on the availability of organs and tissues.\nAt Contoso, we are proud to provide employees with access to Northwind Health Plus coverage, which includes coverage for transplants. We understand the importance of providing employees with access to the medical care they need, which is why we have partnered with Northwind Health to provide our employees with the best coverage available.\nUrgent Care\nCOVERED SERVICES: Urgent Care\nAt Northwind Health Plus, we understand that life can be unpredictable and that sometimes, you may need urgent care. We offer coverage for urgent care services, so you can get the medical attention you need without worrying about the cost.\nIn-Network Coverage\nWhen you visit an in-network urgent care provider, you will pay a co-pay or co-insurance for your visit. You may also be responsible for any additional costs, such as lab tests and x- rays, if they are not covered by your plan.

Health Plus, even if it is received from an out-of- network provider. However, you may be responsible for a higher cost-sharing amount than if you received care from an in-network provider.\nTips for Seeking Urgent Care\nWhen you need urgent care, it is important to remember that not all urgent care facilities are the same. Here are some tips to help you make the best decision for your situation:\n• Do your research: Before you visit an urgent care facility, be sure to research the facility to make sure it is in-network.\n• Make sure the facility is open: Always double-check the hours of operation for the facility you plan to visit.\n• Have your insurance card on hand: Bring your insurance card with you to the visit, as you may need to provide it to the facility.\n• Bring your medical records: If you have any relevant medical records, bring them with you to the facility. This will help the provider make a more informed diagnosis.\n• Know when to go to the emergency room: If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room for treatment.\nWe understand that receiving urgent care can be a stressful situation. At Northwind Health Plus, we strive to make the process as easy and stress-free as possible.

For instance, some services, such as laboratory tests, imaging studies, and mental health services, may not be available via virtual care. It’s also important to note that some services may require prior authorization.\nWe encourage you to take advantage of virtual care services when appropriate. To make the most of your virtual care experience, be sure to:\n• Prepare for your visit: Make sure you have the necessary supplies and documents in advance, such as your insurance card, medical history, and any questions you may have.\n• Follow up: If you need to follow up with your doctor, be sure to do so. Virtual care services are an excellent way to stay in touch with your provider.\n• Follow instructions: Make sure you follow any instructions given to you by your doctor during or after your virtual visit.\n• Contact us: If you have any questions or need help scheduling a virtual visit, please contact Northwind Health customer service.\nAt Contoso, we understand that today’s busy lifestyles can make it difficult to schedule and attend doctor’s appointments.

Prior authorization is a process that requires approval from Northwind Health Plus for certain services and medications before they are covered. Prior authorization is intended to ensure that members receive medically necessary, safe, and cost-effective healthcare services.\nPrior authorization is required for some outpatient services, such as outpatient surgery, some imaging studies and physical therapy, as well as for some medications. Prior authorization is also required for some inpatient services and procedures. Northwind Health Plus may also require prior authorization for other services or medications.\nFor services and medications that require prior authorization, you must contact Northwind Health Plus before receiving the service or medication to determine if prior authorization is required. If so, you will need to obtain prior authorization through the Northwind Health Plus prior authorization process.\nExceptions\nThere are some exceptions to the prior authorization requirement. Certain preventive services, such as annual physicals and routine check-ups do not require prior authorization. In some cases, Northwind Health Plus may also waive the prior authorization requirement for certain services and medications.\nTips for Employees\nIf you think you may need a service or medication that requires prior authorization, it is important to plan ahead and contact Northwind Health Plus before receiving the service or medication. This will help ensure that your service or medication is covered by Northwind Health Plus.\nIf you receive a service or medication without prior authorization, you may be responsible for the entire cost of the service or medication. You can also be billed for any services or medications that are determined to be not medically necessary.\nPrior authorization can take several days to complete, so it is important to plan ahead and contact Northwind Health Plus as soon as possible. Northwind Health Plus may also require\nadditional information, such as medical records or lab results, in order to complete the prior authorization process.\nIf you have any questions about prior authorization, it is important to contact Northwind Health Plus for more information. Northwind Health Plus can provide you with information about prior authorization and help you understand what services and medications require prior authorization.\nHow Prior-Authorization Works CARE MANAGEMENT: Prior-Authorization\nPrior authorization (or pre-authorization) is an important part of the Northwind Health Plus plan. Before certain services and treatments can be covered, they must first be authorized by Northwind Health. This means that your doctor or health care provider will need to get prior authorization from Northwind Health before providing the care.\nPrior authorization is also known as pre-certification, pre-notification, pre-service review, or pre-authorization. It is important for you to understand that prior authorization does not guarantee that the service will be covered by your Northwind Health Plus plan.\nWhen Prior Authorization is Required\nPrior

Prior-authorization is a process used by the insurance company to review a request for a specific service to ensure that it is medically necessary and meets the criteria set by the plan. This process helps to ensure that members are receiving the best care possible and that their benefits are used in the most cost-effective manner.\nIn order to receive prior-authorization, members must provide their Northwind Health Plus provider with the necessary clinical information regarding their diagnosis and treatment plan. The provider then submits this information to Northwind Health Plus for review. Northwind Health Plus will then contact the provider with the decision on the prior- authorization request.\nPrior-authorization is required for certain services, including but not limited to:\n• Inpatient Hospitalizations\n• Outpatient Surgery\n• Durable Medical Equipment\n• Certain Imaging Services\n• Certain Lab Tests\n• Certain Physical and Occupational Therapy Services\n• Certain Prescription Drugs\n• Certain Home Health Services\nIt is important to note that some services do not require prior-authorization, as they are considered non-medically necessary. In addition, some services may only require prior- authorization for certain members, such as those with high-risk conditions.

is not required. In addition, certain pediatric services are exempt from prior-authorization.\nIt is important for members to understand that prior-authorization does not guarantee coverage. The prior-authorization process is used to determine if a service is medically necessary and meets the criteria set by the plan. If a service is not medically necessary or does not meet the criteria set by the plan, the service may be denied.\nIt is also important for members to understand that prior-authorization is not a guarantee that the service will be provided in a timely manner. While Northwind Health Plus strives to make decisions on prior-authorization requests as quickly as possible, the process can take time.\nHere are some tips for members to help ensure that prior-authorization requests are processed in a timely manner:\n• Ensure that all necessary information is provided to the provider when requesting prior- authorization.\n• Make sure that the provider submits the prior-authorization request as soon as possible.\n• Contact the insurance company if you have not received a response after a reasonable amount of time.\n• Ensure that the provider is aware of any changes in the member’s condition that may affect the prior-authorization request.\nPrior-authorization is an important part of the Northwind Health Plus care management system. It helps ensure that members are receiving the best care possible and that their benefits are used in the most cost-effective manner. By understanding prior-authorization and following the tips outlined above, members can help ensure that their prior- authorization requests are processed in a timely manner.\nExceptions To Prior Authorization For Benefit Coverage\nCARE MANAGEMENT: Exceptions To Prior Authorization For Benefit Coverage\nAt Northwind Health Plus, we understand that medical care can be complex and that you may need access to specialized care when needed.

To be approved for prior authorization, you must meet certain criteria and provide certain information. This criteria and information may vary depending on the type of care you are requesting.\nPrior authorization requests must be submitted to Northwind Health by your provider. In most cases, your provider will submit the request for you.

it is important to remember that prior authorization is still required for some services even if they are provided by an out-of-network provider. Prior authorization is a process in which Northwind Health Plus reviews and evaluates the medical necessity of the requested service. This process helps to ensure that the services being requested are medically necessary and are provided in accordance with the plan’s specific rules and guidelines.\nIn conclusion, Northwind Health Plus makes exceptions to the prior authorization requirement for certain services when they are provided by an out-of-network provider. However, it is important to remember that Northwind Health Plus may not cover all of the services provided by an out-of-network provider, that out-of-network providers may charge more than those in-network, and that prior authorization is still required for some services even if they are provided by an out-of-network provider. By being aware of these\nexceptions and tips, employees can ensure that they are making responsible and informed decisions about their healthcare needs.\nClinical Review\nCARE MANAGEMENT – Clinical Review\nNorthwind Health Plus offers several care management services to ensure that members are receiving the best possible care. One of the primary care management services is Clinical Review. Clinical Review is an important process that helps to ensure that members are receiving the most appropriate care and that their care is in line with established clinical guidelines.\nClinical Review involves a team of healthcare professionals who review services, treatments, and medications to ensure that they are medically necessary and appropriate for the individual’s condition. The review team may also look at other factors, such as cost and effectiveness, to ensure that the care provided is in line with established standards.\nClinical Review is available for all care services covered by Northwind Health Plus. This includes preventive care, primary care, specialty care, and hospital services. Clinical Review is also available for services provided by out-of-network providers.\nIn some cases, Clinical Review may result in a denial of coverage for certain services and medications. If a service or medication is denied, the provider will be notified and will have the opportunity to appeal the decision. The appeal process is designed to ensure that members receive the care that is medically necessary and appropriate for them.\nThere are a few exceptions to Clinical Review. In some cases, the review team may not be able to review all of the information necessary to make an appropriate decision. In these cases, the review team may be unable to make a decision and the provider may be able to provide coverage for the service or medication without going through the review process. Additionally, Clinical Review does not apply to services that are not covered by Northwind Health Plus, such as cosmetic surgeries or experimental treatments.\nIt is important to remember that Clinical Review is an important component of quality care. Northwind Health Plus is committed to ensuring that members receive the care that is medically necessary and appropriate for them.\nTips for Employees\n• Talk to your doctor about the care you need. Your doctor can help determine if the services you are requesting are medically necessary and appropriate for your condition.\n• Ask your doctor if he or she is familiar with the Northwind Health Plus Clinical Review process.\n• Make sure your doctor provides accurate and complete information to the review team.\n• If your coverage is denied, talk to your doctor about appealing the decision.\n• If

It is important to understand these exclusions so that you can plan your care accordingly.\nServices Not Covered:\nNorthwind Health Plus does not cover services that are not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery or elective procedures. Additionally, services or treatments that are experimental or investigational are not covered under this plan.\nPrescriptions Not Covered: The plan does not cover prescriptions that are not medically necessary, certain over-the-counter medications, or prescription medications that are used to enhance performance in athletics.\nMental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment: The plan does not cover mental health or substance abuse treatment services provided by a non-network provider or any services that are not medically necessary.\nPreventive Care: Northwind Health Plus does not cover preventive care services provided by a non-network provider.\nTips for Avoiding Exclusions\nWhen considering a medical service or treatment, it is important to review the plan's evidence of coverage to ensure that the service or treatment is covered under the plan. You should also discuss the service or treatment with your doctor to ensure that it is medically necessary. Additionally, you should review the list of excluded services and prescriptions to ensure that you are not seeking treatment for an excluded service or prescription.\nIf you are considering a medical service or treatment that is not covered under the plan, you should discuss payment options with your doctor or healthcare provider. Additionally, you may need to consider other payment sources, such as private insurance, flexible spending accounts, or state or federal programs.\nFinally, it is important to understand the plan's coverage limits and to keep track of all out- of-pocket expenses. You should also be aware of your plan's annual deductible and coinsurance amounts.\nBy understanding Northwind Health Plus's exclusions and following the tips outlined above, you can ensure that you are receiving the most comprehensive coverage available under the plan and avoid any unexpected costs.\nWHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?\nCoordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans\nWHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?\nCoordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans\nIf you have other health care coverage, such as Medicare or a health plan from another employer, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. Coordinating benefits means that both plans work together to pay for covered services. This coordination helps to ensure that you don’t pay more than you should for your health care.\nWhen coordinating benefits, one plan pays first and the other plan pays what is left after the first plan has paid. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays second is called the secondary plan. Generally, the primary plan pays up to the amount of its allowed amount for the services you received.

Northwind Health Plus. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 years of age and older, people with certain disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Northwind Health Plus is a secondary payer to Medicare, meaning that Medicare will pay first and then Northwind Health Plus will pay the remaining balance after Medicare has paid its portion.\nIf you have Medicare, you will need to use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network to coordinate benefits with your Medicare coverage. Medicare will pay first and then Northwind Health Plus will pay the remaining balance.\nCoordinating Benefits with Other Employer Plans\nIf you are covered under a health plan from another employer, that plan is usually considered the primary payer and Northwind Health Plus is considered the secondary payer. Your other employer plan will pay first and then Northwind Health Plus will pay the remaining balance after the other employer plan has paid its portion.\nTo coordinate benefits with your other employer plan, you must use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network. You will need to provide your other employer plan’s information in order to coordinate benefits.\nExceptions\nThere are a few exceptions to coordinating benefits with other health care plans. For example, you cannot coordinate benefits with a health plan that is not a major medical plan. Also, if you are enrolled in a health plan that is a high-deductible plan, you cannot coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus until you have met the deductible.\nTips\nIf you have other health care coverage, here are a few tips to help you coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus:\n• Make sure you have your other health care plan’s information handy when you use Northwind Health Plus.\n• Always use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network to ensure that your benefits are coordinated correctly.\n• Make sure you understand your plan’s rules for coordinating benefits.\n• Ask your doctor or other health care provider about the cost of services before you receive them to make sure that you are not paying more than you should.\n• Read your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) carefully to make sure that your benefits are being coordinated correctly.\nBy understanding how to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus and other health care plans, you can make sure that you are getting the most out of your health care coverage.\nCOB Definitions\nWHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?\nThe term “Other Coverage” is defined as any other insurance, health plan, or other coverage which provides benefits and services for medical care that is also provided under the Northwind Health Plus plan. This includes, but is not limited to, Medicare, TRICARE, Medicaid, employer-sponsored plans, and government-sponsored plans.\nWhen you have Other Coverage, Northwind Health Plus follows something called “Coordination of Benefits” (COB). This means that Northwind Health Plus coordinates its benefits with the Other Coverage in order to ensure that you receive the maximum amount of benefits available to you. Northwind Health Plus will pay benefits only after the Other Coverage pays its benefits.\nTo understand how COB works, it is important to understand the following terms:\n• Primary Coverage: This is the coverage that pays benefits first.\n• Secondary Coverage: This is the coverage that pays benefits after the Primary Coverage has paid out its benefits.\n• Crossover Claims: These are claims that are submitted to both the Primary Coverage and the Secondary Coverage at the same time.\nIn order for Northwind Health Plus to serve as the Secondary Coverage, you must provide us with a copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that you receive from your Primary Coverage.

important because it affects how much you will pay out-of-pocket for care.\nWhen Northwind Health Plus is the primary insurance (the plan that pays benefits first), any other insurance you may have will become the secondary insurance and only pays benefits if there are unpaid charges from the primary plan. However, if Northwind Health Plus is the secondary plan, then it pays benefits after the primary plan has paid its share.\nThe amount Northwind Health Plus pays for a covered service depends on the coverage of the primary plan and the total amount charged for the service. Northwind Health Plus may pay up to the amount of the maximum allowable charge, which is the maximum amount the plan pays for a service.\nIf you have more than one health insurance policy, you may need to provide proof of the other coverage, such as an insurance card or a letter from the other insurer, to verify which plan is primary and which is secondary.\nWhen you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the benefits correctly.\nWhen you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the benefits correctly. It is important to note that Northwind Health Plus does not coordinate benefits with Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE programs.\nWhen coordinating benefits, there are a few important exceptions to keep in mind. If you are covered by a spouse's health plan, the primary plan is usually the plan that covers the spouse and the secondary plan is usually the plan that covers you. Additionally, if you are covered by more than one group plan, the primary plan is usually the plan of the employer who has the most employees.\nFollowing these tips can help you understand how COB works and how to get the most out of your health coverage:\n• Understand the coverage of all of your health plans so that you know which plan is primary and which is secondary.\n• Contact your health care providers and make sure they are aware of all of your coverage and that they know how to coordinate benefits.\n• Keep copies of your insurance cards, letters from insurers, and other documents that explain your coverage.\n• Contact Northwind Health Plus if you have any questions or need help understanding how COB works.\nBy understanding your coverage and being aware of how COB works, you can ensure that you are getting the most out of your health plan and that you are not paying more out of pocket than you need to.\nSubrogation And Reimbursement\nSubrogation and Reimbursement\nSubrogation and reimbursement are two important concepts to understand when it comes to Northwind Health Plus insurance. Subrogation is the process by which Northwind Health Plus can seek reimbursement from another insurance company if you have secondary medical coverage. In other words, if you have coverage through Northwind Health Plus and another insurance provider, Northwind Health Plus may be able to recoup the costs of medical services they paid for from the other insurance company.\nReimbursement works in the opposite way. It is the process by which Northwind Health Plus can reimburse you for certain medical expenses that you paid for out-of-pocket. This is beneficial if you received medical services that were not covered by Northwind Health Plus.\nWhen it comes to subrogation and reimbursement, it is important to note that Northwind Health Plus reserves the right to subrogate and reimburse any payments made for medical services. This includes payments made directly by you and other insurance companies.

does not cover the services that you received. This means that if your primary insurance covers the services that you received, Northwind Health Plus will not seek reimbursement.\nWhen it comes to reimbursement, there are certain exceptions to Northwind Health Plus’s policy. For example, Northwind Health Plus will not reimburse you for any medical services that were covered by another insurance provider. Additionally, Northwind Health Plus will not reimburse you for any medical services that you received from an out-of-network provider, unless the service was deemed medically necessary and was not available from an in-network provider.\nFinally, it is important to remember that Northwind Health Plus may require that you submit certain documentation in order to receive reimbursement. This documentation may include itemized bills, proof of payment, and/or medical records.\nIn order to ensure that you are able to take full advantage of Northwind Health Plus’s subrogation and reimbursement policy, it is important to keep detailed records of all medical services that you receive. This includes records of payments made by you, other insurance companies, and Northwind Health Plus. Additionally, it is important to keep a record of any documentation you submit to Northwind Health Plus to support your\nreimbursement claim. Keeping these records will help to ensure that you receive the full reimbursement that you are entitled to under the Northwind Health Plus policy.\nUninsured And Underinsured Motorist/Personal Injury Protection Coverage\nWHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?\nUninsured and Underinsured Motorist/Personal Injury Protection Coverage\nUninsured and Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM) coverage is an optional form of coverage that may be included in Northwind Health Plus. This coverage will help protect you and your passengers if you’re injured in an accident caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver.\nIf you have UM/UIM coverage, it will provide coverage for medical bills, lost wages, and other expenses that you may incur as a result of an accident. However, it is important to note that UM/UIM coverage only applies when the other driver is at fault, and does not cover damage to your vehicle or property.\nThere are a few exceptions to the coverage provided by UM/UIM coverage. For example, it does not cover intentional acts of another driver, damage caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver in a hit-and-run accident, or damage to your vehicle or property.\nIt is important to understand the limits of your UM/UIM coverage and any exclusions that may apply. You should make sure to review your policy thoroughly to ensure that you are properly covered.\nIn addition to understanding the limits of your coverage, there are other tips that you can use to help protect yourself in the event of an accident.\nFirst, make sure that you have a valid driver’s license and that the other driver does as well. It’s also important to make sure that the other driver has valid insurance coverage. You may want to ask to see proof of insurance before you get in the car.\nIf you do get into an accident, it’s important to stay calm and take down the other driver’s name, contact information, and insurance information. You should also call the police and make sure to file a police report. This will help provide evidence of the accident and can be used to pursue a claim with your insurance company.\nFinally, if you do find yourself in an accident, make sure to contact your Northwind Health Plus insurance provider as soon as possible to file a claim.

We have a multi-level process in place to ensure that any grievances are addressed and resolved quickly and fairly.\nLevel 1: Initial Review\nThis is the first step in the appeals process. If you have a problem with a service or product received, contact the plan's Customer Service team. The team will review your complaint to determine if a solution can be reached or if the complaint should be escalated to the next level.\nLevel 2: Formal Complaint\nIf a satisfactory resolution is not reached at Level 1, you may submit a formal written complaint to Northwind Health Plus. This should include details of the issue, the date and time of the incident, and the names of any involved personnel. It should also include any relevant documentation or other evidence that supports your claim.\nLevel 3: External Review\nIf the issue is not resolved at Level 2, you may request an external review to be conducted. This review will be conducted by an independent organization that is not affiliated with Northwind Health Plus. The external review will consider all facts and evidence that have been submitted in the appeal and make a final decision on the matter.\nExceptions\nThere are some exceptions to the appeals process. If the issue involves a claim that is more than one year old, the appeal must be denied. Additionally, if the claim was filed more than two years after the date of service, the appeal must also be denied.\nTips\nIf you have a complaint or appeal, it is important to remember the following tips:\n• Gather all relevant evidence and documents that support your claim.\n• Submit your complaint or appeal in writing and keep a copy for your own records.\n• Be sure to include all relevant

As a participant in this group plan, you will have access to a wide range of health benefits and services.\nYour employer, Contoso, pays a portion of the premium for the plan, and you are responsible for paying the remaining portion. This will be deducted directly from your paycheck each month.

For example, if you choose a single plan, you will pay a lower premium than if you choose a family plan.

You should review your plan documents carefully to make sure you understand exactly what is covered and what is excluded.\nIt is also important to understand that the plan is not a substitute for health insurance.

Health’s customer service to answer any questions or address any concerns you may have about your plan.\nHealthcare Providers - Independent Contractors\nOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN\nHealthcare Providers - Independent Contractors\nThe Northwind Health Plus plan includes coverage for healthcare services provided by independent contractors. This means that services provided by independent contractors may be covered under the Northwind Health Plus plan, provided that the service is medically necessary.\nIndependent contractors are healthcare providers that are not employed by Northwind Health or any other company or organization. They are self-employed and provide services on a contract basis. These services can include medical, vision, and dental services, as well as prescription drug coverage and mental health and substance abuse coverage.\nIt is important to note that services provided by independent contractors are not covered under the Northwind Health Plus plan unless they are necessary to treat an illness or injury. For example, a physical therapist who is an independent contractor may be covered under the plan if the services are necessary to treat an illness or injury. However, services\nprovided by an independent contractor that are not medically necessary, such as a massage therapist or acupuncturist, are not covered under the plan.\nWhen selecting a healthcare provider, it is important to make sure that the provider is an independent contractor and is covered under the Northwind Health Plus plan. You can do this by checking the provider’s website or calling the provider’s office to confirm that they are an independent contractor and that their services are covered under the Northwind Health Plus plan.\nIt is also important to note that any services that you receive from an independent contractor may be subject to a deductible or coinsurance. This means that you may be responsible for a portion of the cost of the service. It is important to check with the provider to confirm the cost of the service before receiving any services.\nFinally, it is important to remember that services that are provided by an independent contractor are not covered under the Northwind Health Plus plan unless they are necessary to treat an illness or injury. If you have any questions about whether a service is covered under the plan, it is important to contact Northwind Health or the healthcare provider to confirm coverage.\nIntentionally False Or Misleading Statements\nOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN: Intentionally False or Misleading Statements\nIt’s important to be aware of intentionally false or misleading statements when it comes to health insurance plans.

paid a bill for a medical service that is covered under the plan. This is important because it can help you recover any expenses that you have already paid out-of-pocket, including co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles.\nUnder this provision, you must first file a claim with the insurance company, and then the insurance company can attempt to recover the money that you have already paid from the provider who charged you. In some cases, if you have already paid the provider, they may be willing to reimburse you directly.\nHowever, there are some restrictions and exceptions to this provision that you should be aware of. First, the Right of Recovery provision only applies to services that are covered under the plan. It does not apply to services that are not covered or services that are subject to limitations or exclusions. Second, the Right of Recovery provision only applies to claims that are filed within six months of the date of service.\nAlso, keep in mind that the Right of Recovery provision does not guarantee that the insurance company will be able to recover the money that you have already paid. The insurance company may be unable to recover the money that you have paid, or they may not be able to recover the entire amount. In these cases, the insurance company may offer to reimburse you for some portion of the money that you have already paid.\nFinally, if you have already paid a provider for a service that is covered under the plan, it is important to keep any receipts or other documentation. This documentation will be necessary if you decide to file a Right of Recovery claim with the insurance company.\nTo sum up, the Right of Recovery provision in Northwind's Health Plus plan is a great way to help you recover any money that you have already paid for medical services that are covered under the plan. However, there are some restrictions and exceptions to this provision, so be sure to review the plan documents carefully before filing a claim. Additionally, if you have already paid a provider for a service that is covered under the plan, be sure to keep any receipts or other documentation, as this may be necessary if you decide to file a claim.\nRight To And Payment Of Benefits\nOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN: Right To And Payment Of Benefits\nUnder the Northwind Health Plus plan, members are entitled to receive the benefits listed in the plan documents.

illness.\nIt is important to note that Workers’ Compensation Insurance does not cover personal injuries that are not related to an employee’s job duties, such as an injury resulting from a car accident. Also, if an employee is injured while engaging in illegal activities, they are not eligible for Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage.\nEmployees should report any injuries or illnesses to their supervisor as soon as possible in order to ensure that their claim is handled in a timely manner. Employees should also be aware that their employer must have the appropriate paperwork on file in order for them to be eligible for Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage.\nIn some cases, an employee may be able to receive additional benefits beyond what is provided by Workers’ Compensation Insurance. These benefits may include disability benefits, unemployment benefits, or Social Security benefits. It is important for employees to research these options in order to determine if they are eligible for any additional benefits.\nWhen an employee is injured or becomes ill, they should contact the Workers’ Compensation Insurance provider immediately. The provider will provide the employee with information on the process and how to file a claim. The provider may also provide additional resources to help the employee understand their rights and responsibilities.\nIt is important for employees to remember that Workers’ Compensation Insurance is a benefit that is provided by the employer. It is the employer’s responsibility to ensure that employees are aware of the Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage and to make sure that employees are taking advantage of the coverage.\nFinally, it is important for employees to remember that Workers’ Compensation Insurance does not cover all injuries or illnesses. If an employee has any questions or concerns about their coverage, they should contact their employer or the Workers’ Compensation Insurance provider for more information.\nDEFINITIONS\nDefinitions\nIt is important for employees to understand the definitions of certain terms when it comes to their health insurance plan. The following definitions will help employees obtain a better understanding of Northwind Health Plus.\nCopayment: A copayment, also known as a copay, is the fixed amount that an employee pays for a covered service. This amount is usually a flat fee and is due at the time of service.\nDeductible: A deductible is the amount of money that an employee must pay out-of-pocket before the plan begins paying for covered services. Northwind Health Plus has a deductible of $2,000 per year.\nCoinsurance: Coinsurance is the percentage of the cost of a covered service that an employee must pay after the deductible is met. Northwind Health Plus has a coinsurance of 20%.\nOut-of-Pocket Maximum: The out-of-pocket maximum is the maximum amount of money that an employee has to pay for covered services in a plan year. This amount includes the deductible, coinsurance, and copayments. Northwind Health Plus has an out-of-pocket maximum of $4,000 per year.\nIn-Network Provider: An in-network provider is a health care provider or facility that is contracted with the insurance company. Employees who use an in-network provider will have lower copayments and coinsurance amounts than those who use an out-of-network provider.\nOut-of-Network Provider: An out-of-network provider is a health care provider or facility that is not contracted with the insurance company. Employees who use an out-of-network provider will have higher copayments and coinsurance amounts than those who use an in- network provider.\nExceptions\nNorthwind Health Plus does have some
