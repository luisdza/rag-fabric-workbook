Electronics Northwind Health Standard Plan\nContoso Electronics\nThis document contains information generated using a language model (Azure OpenAI). The information contained in this document is only for demonstration purposes and does not reflect the opinions or beliefs of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability or availability with respect to the information contained in this document.\nAll rights reserved to Microsoft\nSummary of Benefits\nNorthwind Standard\nNorthwind Standard is a basic plan that provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental services. This plan also offers coverage for preventive care services, as well as prescription drug coverage. With Northwind Standard, you can choose from a variety of in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This plan does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network services.\nSUMMARY OF YOUR COSTS\nSummary of Your Costs\nWhen you choose Northwind Standard as your health plan, you can rest assured that you are getting comprehensive coverage at an affordable cost. Here, we will explain the various costs associated with this plan so that you know what to expect when it comes to your out- of-pocket expenses.\nPremiums\nPremiums are the amount of money that you will need to pay each month for your coverage. Northwind Standard requires that premiums be paid on a monthly basis in order to keep the coverage in force. These premiums are based on the age and health of the policy holder, as well as the type of coverage that is chosen.\nDeductibles\nA deductible is the amount of money that you will need to pay out of pocket before your insurance plan will begin to cover the costs of your medical services. The deductible for Northwind Standard is $2,000 per person, per year. This means that you will need to pay the first $2,000 of your medical expenses before the plan will begin to cover the remaining amount.\nCo-payments and Co-insurance\nOnce you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for co-payments and co- insurance. Co-payments are a fixed amount that you will need to pay at the time of service, while co-insurance is a percentage that you will need to pay. For Northwind Standard, the co-payment is $30 for primary care visits and $50 for specialist visits. The co-insurance is 20% of the remaining cost after the deductible has been met.\nOut-of-Pocket Maximum\nThe out-of-pocket maximum for Northwind Standard is $6,000 per person, per year. This is the maximum amount that you will need to pay for your medical expenses in a given year.\nOnce you have reached this limit, the plan will cover 100% of your expenses for the remainder of the year.\nTips for Managing Your Costs\nThere are several steps that you can take to help manage your costs when you are enrolled in Northwind Standard. Here are a few tips that you can use to get the most out of your coverage:\n• Make sure to take advantage of preventive care services. These services are covered 100% by the plan and can help you avoid more costly treatments down the line.\n• Always make sure to visit in-network providers. Doing so will ensure that you receive the maximum benefit from your plan.\n• Consider generic prescription drugs when available. These drugs can often be cheaper than brand-name drugs and are just as effective.\n• Talk to your doctor about ways to save money. Many doctors are willing to work with you to find the most cost-effective treatment options available.\n• Review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statements carefully.

PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS\nWhen selecting a health insurance plan, one of the most important factors to consider is the network of in-network providers that are available with the plan.\nNorthwind Standard offers a wide variety of in-network providers, ranging from primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This allows you to choose a provider that is convenient for you and your family, while also helping you to keep your costs low.\nWhen you choose a provider that is in-network with your plan, you will typically pay lower copays and deductibles than you would with an out-of-network provider. In addition, many services, such as preventive care, may be covered at no cost when you receive care from an in-network provider.\nIt is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network\nservices. This means that you may have to pay out of pocket for these services if you receive them from an out-of-network provider.\nWhen choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, make sure that the provider you choose is in-network with your plan. You can confirm this by calling the provider's office and asking them if they are in-network with Northwind Standard. You can also use the provider search tool on the Northwind Health website to make sure your provider is in-network.\nSecond, make sure that the provider you choose is accepting new patients. Some providers may be in-network but not be taking new patients.\nThird, consider the location of the provider. If the provider is too far away, it may be difficult for you to get to your appointments.\nFinally, consider the provider's office hours. If you work during the day, you may need to find a provider that has evening or weekend hours.\nChoosing an in-network provider can help you save money on your health care costs. By following the tips above and researching your options, you can find a provider that is convenient, affordable, and in-network with your Northwind Standard plan.\nContinuity of Care\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: CONTINUITY OF CARE\nAt Contoso, we understand the importance of providing our employees with access to a quality, affordable health care plan. We are proud to offer our employees Northwind Standard, an insurance plan that provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental services. We also offer continuity of care, which is the ability to stay with the same provider for all your health care needs, from routine checkups to specialized care.\nContinuity of care is an important component of any health care plan, as it allows you to develop a relationship with your doctor, who is more likely to recognize any changes in your health and be able to provide better, more personalized care. With Northwind Standard, you can stay with the same provider throughout your health care journey, helping you to receive the best possible care.\nContinuity of care also helps you save money on health care costs. When you stay with the same provider, you are likely to pay less than if you switch around from provider to provider. This is because your provider already has all your medical records, and you won’t need to pay for expensive tests and procedures that you’ve already had done.\nThere are a few exceptions to the continuity of care. If you move to a different area, you may need to find a new provider. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, such as surgery or a complex treatment, you may need to visit a specialist who does not accept your insurance plan. In these cases, you should be sure to check with your insurance company and/or provider to make sure you understand any associated costs.\nThere are a few tips you can follow to ensure you are taking full advantage of continuity of care and are getting the best, most affordable care possible.

change providers, be sure to notify your insurance company right away. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, be sure to check with your provider to understand any associated costs. Finally, if you are switching providers or insurance plans, make sure you get copies of your medical records from your previous provider.\nAt Contoso, we strive to provide our employees with access to quality, affordable health care. We are proud to offer Northwind Standard, an insurance plan that provides continuity of care, helping you to receive the best possible care and save money on health care costs.\nNon-Participating\nNon-Participating Providers and How They Affect Your Costs\nWhen selecting a health care provider, it is important to understand the differences between participating and non-participating providers. Participating providers are those who have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard health plan’s set rates. Non- participating providers are those who have not agreed to accept the set rates and can charge the patient more than what the health plan pays.\nWhen you choose a non-participating provider for your healthcare services, you may be responsible for paying the difference between the provider’s actual charges and the amount the plan pays. This difference is known as the balance billing amount. Depending on your provider’s policy, you may be required to pay the balance billing amount up front. Be sure to discuss this with your provider prior to receiving services.\nAdditionally, it is important to note that if you use a non-participating provider, your out-of- pocket costs may be higher than if you had used a participating provider. For example, if your provider’s charge is $200 and the plan pays $100, you would be responsible for the remaining $100 balance billing amount.\nExceptions\nThere are certain exceptions to the rule of non-participating providers. Your health plan may cover emergency services provided by non-participating providers, as well as certain services provided by non-participating providers that are not available from participating providers. Additionally, in some cases, the health plan may cover non-participating providers’ charges if there are no participating providers in your area.\nTips\nIn order to avoid costly balance billing amounts, it is important to make sure that your provider is a participating provider in your Northwind Standard health plan. If you are unsure, you can contact the customer service department of your health plan to verify.\nIt is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find out if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill you after the health plan pays them.\nWhen selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating providers are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some providers offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services.\nFinally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check with your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service. Additionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about the cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate.\nBalance Billing Protection\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS - Balance Billing Protection\nAt Contoso, we understand that medical costs can be intimidating and confusing, which is why we’ve partnered with Northwind Health to offer our employees the Northwind Standard plan.

often unexpected. With the Northwind Standard plan, you are protected from balance billing when visiting in-network providers.\nWhat is an in-network provider?\nIn-network providers are healthcare providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and labs, that have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard plan’s payment terms. Visiting an in-network provider means that you are protected from balance billing. You can find a list of in-network providers on the Northwind Health website.\nWhat if I visit an out-of-network provider?\nVisiting an out-of-network provider means that you are not protected from balance billing. Out-of-network providers may charge more for the same services than in-network providers, and you may be responsible for the difference between what they charge and what your insurance company is willing to pay. It is important to check if a provider is in- network before visiting them to avoid any unexpected costs.\nTips to avoid balance billing:\n• Always check if a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment.\n• Ask your provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan before you receive any services.\n• Double-check that the providers you visit are in-network.\n• Ask for an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs ahead of time.\n• If you receive a bill for more than expected, contact your provider and the insurance company to negotiate a lower cost.\nExceptions to the balance billing protection:\n• Balance billing protection does not apply to emergency services.\n• Balance billing protection does not apply to mental health and substance abuse coverage.\n• Balance billing protection does not apply to out-of-network providers.\n• Balance billing protection is not applicable to any non-covered services.\nAt Contoso, we want to make sure our employees are provided with the best coverage options. That’s why we’ve partnered with Northwind Health to offer the Northwind Standard plan, which provides balance billing protection when visiting in-network providers. We encourage our employees to use the tips provided to help reduce the risk of unexpected costs when visiting a provider.\nBenefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers\nOne of the important considerations when choosing a health insurance plan is understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers. When you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs.\nUnder Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs.\nIn-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan. In-network providers may also offer additional services or discounts that are not available to out-of-network providers.\nOut-of-Network: Out-of-network providers are those who have not contracted with Northwind Health. As a result, they are not required to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the cost.

it is important to understand that you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure that you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is recommended that you choose an in-network provider whenever possible.\nThere are some exceptions when it comes to receiving care from out-of-network providers. If you are unable to find an in-network provider in your area or if you require a specific type of care that is not available from an in-network provider, you may receive care from an out- of-network provider. In these cases, the cost of care may be more expensive and you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs.\nIn addition to understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers, it is important to understand the cost sharing associated with each. Northwind Standard does not cover the full cost of care for out-of-network providers, so you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs.\nWhen choosing a provider, it is important to take into account the cost sharing associated with each provider. If you are unable to find an in-network provider in your area or if you require a specific type of care that is not available from an in-network provider, it is important to understand that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs.\nFinally, it is important to be aware of any additional fees that may be associated with receiving care from an out-of-network provider. Some providers may charge additional fees for services that are not covered by Northwind Standard. It is important to ask about any additional fees before receiving care from an out-of-network provider to make sure you are aware of any additional costs you may be responsible for.\nBy understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers, as well as the cost sharing associated with each, you can make sure that you are getting the best value for your health care expenses. While it is possible to receive care from an out-of- network provider, it is important to understand that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. When choosing a provider, it is important to consider the cost sharing associated with each provider and to ask about any additional fees before receiving care.\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS\nWhen it comes to health insurance, many people are unaware of the different factors that impact the costs they pay. One of the most significant components that affects your costs is the provider you choose. Northwind Standard provides coverage for a variety of in-network\nproviders, and the costs associated with each provider can vary significantly. To ensure you’re getting the best value for your health care services, it’s important to understand how providers can affect your costs.\nIn-Network Providers\nChoosing in-network providers is the most cost-effective option when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan. In-network providers have agreed to accept a discounted rate on services, which means they are often less expensive than out-of-network providers. When selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for services, often referred to as a “co-pay” or “co-insurance”. It’s important to note that different types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it’s best to contact your provider to understand what the cost will be.\nOut-of-Network Providers\nNorthwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs associated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network providers. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire cost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network provider.

providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan coverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for services that are not covered. Additionally, it’s important to note that there may be different rules and coverage levels associated with certain types of services, such as those related to mental health and substance abuse.\nTips\nIf you’re considering a provider that is not in-network, it’s important to understand the costs associated with that provider before you book an appointment. Contacting the provider directly to ask about their rates, as well as any special arrangements they offer for Northwind Standard members, can help you get a better idea of what you’ll be paying for services. Additionally, it’s important to check with Northwind Health to make sure the provider is covered by the Northwind Standard plan and what types of services are covered.\nWhen selecting a provider, it’s also important to consider the quality of care they provide. You should look for providers that offer high-quality care that meets your specific needs. Additionally, Northwind Health offers a variety of resources to help you find the right provider, such as a provider search tool and a provider directory.\nChoosing the right provider is important when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan. By understanding how providers can affect your costs, you can make sure you’re getting the\nbest value for your health care services. By using Northwind Health’s resources and researching providers in advance, you can make sure you’re getting the care you need at the best cost.\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION\nCopayments (Copays)\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays)\nAt Northwind Health, our Northwind Standard plan includes copayments (copays) for certain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you pay at the time of service, and it is generally a lower amount than what you would have to pay if you were to pay the full cost of the service.\nCopays for Northwind Standard vary depending on the type of service you receive. Generally speaking, copays for office visits are typically less than copays for hospital visits. For example, copays for office visits with a primary care physician may be $20, while copays for a hospital visit may be up to $150. It is important to note that the copays may vary from provider to provider and from state to state.\nIn addition to office visits, copays may also apply to other services, such as prescriptions and diagnostic testing. For example, copays for generic prescription drugs may be $10, while copays for brand-name drugs may be $35. Copays for diagnostic testing, such as lab tests and X-rays, may range from $20 to $100 depending on the type of test.\nIt is important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover certain services, such as emergency services and mental health and substance abuse services. For these services, you may be responsible for the full cost of the service, so it is important to understand your plan and read the fine print before receiving any services.\nIn addition to copays, you may also be charged coinsurance for certain services. Coinsurance is a percentage of the cost of the service that you are responsible for paying. Generally speaking, coinsurance rates are lower than copays, so it is important to understand the difference between the two.\nFinally, there are some exceptions to the copayment rules. For example, preventive care services may be covered at no cost to you. This includes routine physical exams, immunizations, and screenings for certain diseases such as cancer and diabetes.\nOverall, copays are a great way to save money on health care services.

A calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. The deductible applies to most services received from in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies.\nHowever, there are some exceptions. For example, preventive care services, such as immunizations and annual physicals, are covered at 100% with no deductible. Additionally, prescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of $250 per individual and $500 per family.\nIt is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year. This means that you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins to pay. Additionally, the deductible may not apply to all services. For example, you may not be subject to the deductible when you receive in-network emergency services.\nTips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible\nMeeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task, but there are a few steps you can take to help ensure that you reach it.\nFirst, take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100%.

using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical costs.\nFinally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers offer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket.\nBy following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan.\nCoinsurance\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance\nCoinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. For\nexample, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%.\nUnder Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some exceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally, coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%.\nIt’s important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by the plan’s copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally, Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services.\nWhen you receive services, it’s important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs. It’s also important to be aware of the coinsurance rate for out-of-network services and to consider if it’s worth the cost to pay more for out-of- network services.\nIt’s also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the actual cost.\nIf you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment.\nFinally, it’s important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your out-of- pocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket for services.\nIn summary, coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under Northwind Standard that is typically 20% for in-network services and 40% for out-of-network services. It’s important to be aware of the costs associated with coinsurance and to consider if it’s worth the cost to pay more for out-of-network services. Additionally, coinsurance costs count towards your out-of-pocket maximum and you can make payments over time if needed.\nOut-Of-Pocket Maximum IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Out-of-Pocket Maximum\nEmployees enrolled in the Northwind Standard plan can benefit from an out-of-pocket maximum that helps to protect them from large medical bills. This limit applies to certain covered services and includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. The out-of-pocket maximum for the Northwind Standard plan is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family.\nEmployees should be aware that certain services may not be subject to the out-of-pocket maximum. These services include any charges that are not related to the diagnosis and treatment of an illness or injury.

to remember that the out-of-pocket maximum will reset at the start of the calendar year. This means that any out-of-pocket expenses paid during the previous year will not carry over to the new year.\nTo keep track of their out-of-pocket expenses, employees should review their insurance statements regularly. They should also review their Explanation of Benefits (EOB) documents to make sure that all of their expenses have been properly accounted for. This can help them to stay on top of their out-of-pocket expenses and avoid exceeding the maximum.\nEmployees should also be aware that the out-of-pocket maximum does not include the cost of premiums. The cost of premiums is not counted toward the out-of-pocket maximum and is in addition to any out-of-pocket expenses that employees incur.\nFinally, if employees are thinking of switching to a different health plan, they should be aware that out-of-pocket costs can vary from plan to plan. Employees should compare the out-of-pocket maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is best for them.\nIn summary, the Northwind Standard plan offers employees an out-of-pocket maximum of $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Employees should be aware that certain services are not subject to this maximum and that their out-of-pocket expenses will reset at the start of the calendar year. They should also remember that the out-of-pocket maximum does not include the cost of premiums. Finally, they should compare the out-of-pocket maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is best for them.\nAllowed Amount\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: ALLOWED AMOUNT\nIn the Northwind Standard plan, an Allowed Amount is the maximum amount that the plan will pay for a covered service. It includes both the amount that the plan pays and any amount that the insured is responsible for paying. This total Allowed Amount is usually a percentage of the provider's charge. In some cases, the Allowed Amount may be a fixed amount.\nIn general, the Allowed Amount is the lesser of the provider's charge, the plan's Allowed Amount, and the copayment amount. This means that the insured may be responsible for paying the difference between the provider's charge and the Allowed Amount.\nIt is important to remember that the Allowed Amount may not cover the entire cost of a service. Therefore, the insured may be responsible for paying any remaining balance, even if it is more than the Allowed Amount.\nExceptions:\nIn some cases, a service may not have an Allowed Amount or the Allowed Amount may be higher than the provider's charge. This may occur when the service is considered to be a non-covered service or when the service is not a usual or customary service. In these cases, the insured will be responsible for paying the entire cost of the service.\nIn addition, some services may have a separate deductible or coinsurance amount that must be met before the Allowed Amount is applied. These services may include hospitalization, emergency services, and certain types of outpatient services.\nTips:\nWhen selecting a provider, ask the provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan and what their Allowed Amounts are. This will ensure that you are selecting a provider that will accept the plan and that you are aware of what your out-of-pocket costs may be.\nMake sure to keep all of your receipts and bills when you receive a service so that you can review them against your Explanation of Benefits (EOB). This will ensure that you are aware of any balance that may be owed after the Allowed Amount has been applied.\nFinally, remember that the Allowed Amount is not a guarantee of payment and that you may be responsible for paying any remaining balance.

These treatments have the potential to revolutionize the way we treat cancer and other diseases, and they offer a new, innovative approach to medical care.\nCellular immunotherapy is a form of treatment that uses the patient’s own immune system to fight off cancer cells. It works by taking cells from the patient and manipulating them in a laboratory to make them better equipped to fight cancer. The modified cells are then injected back into the patient’s body, where they can help to fight off the cancer.

treatments and therapies not yet available. Northwind Standard offers coverage for certain clinical trial services, including those related to common diseases and conditions.\nThe Northwind Standard plan covers the cost of certain clinical trial services, and some of the most common include:\n• Diagnostic testing and procedures to confirm or diagnose a condition or disease\n• Treatment of the condition or disease being studied\n• Medications\n• Lab services\n• Imaging services\nAny other clinical trial services that are not explicitly covered by the Northwind Standard plan may be eligible for coverage on a case-by-case basis. To determine if a clinical trial service is covered, members should contact the Northwind Health customer service department for more information.\nIt's important for members to note that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover travel expenses associated with attending clinical trials. Additionally, any experimental treatments or services that are not part of the clinical trial are not covered.\nWhen considering participation in a clinical trial, members should always consult with their doctor first to make sure it's the right choice for them. Clinical trials are not for everyone, and it's important to fully understand the risks and benefits before making a decision.\nMembers should also be aware that not all clinical trials are free. Some require a fee, and it's important to find out what the cost will be before participating.\nFinally, members should keep in mind that clinical trials are often available in limited locations, so they may have to travel to participate in a trial. Northwind Health can provide information about nearby clinical trials and may be able to help with the cost of travel.\nAt Northwind Health, we are committed to providing access to the most innovative treatments and therapies available. We are proud to offer coverage for certain clinical trial services, and we are dedicated to helping our members get the care they need.\nDental Injury and Facility Anesthesia\nCOVERED SERVICES: Dental Injury and Facility Anesthesia\nThe Northwind Standard plan offers coverage for dental injuries and anesthesia administered in a dental facility. This coverage covers the services of a licensed dentist or dental specialist, including services related to the diagnosis and treatment of dental injuries, such as root canals, crowns, fillings, extractions, and periodontal services. This coverage also includes dental anesthesia used during a dental procedure, such as local anesthesia, sedation, and general anesthesia.\nHowever, there are some exceptions to the coverage of dental injury and facility anesthesia. The plan does not cover services related to cosmetic dentistry or services related to the replacement of natural teeth with dentures or bridges. Additionally, services related to orthodontics, temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), or treatment of temporomandibular joint disorder are not covered. The Northwind Standard plan only covers services related to the prevention and treatment of disease.\nWhen it comes to dental injuries, it is important to get treatment as soon as possible. If a dental injury is left untreated, it can lead to a greater risk of infection and more extensive dental work in the long run. To make sure you’re getting the best care possible, it is important to find a dentist that is in-network and covered under the Northwind Standard plan. You can search for an in-network provider by using the Northwind Health Provider Finder tool.\nWhen it comes to anesthesia, it is important to talk to your dentist about all of the risks associated with anesthesia before having any procedures. General anesthesia carries the most risk and can cause side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.

it is important to stay up-to-date on your dental care and practice good oral hygiene. Regular brushing and flossing, as well as regular check-ups with your dentist, can help to prevent dental injuries and other dental issues. It is also important to make sure that you are taking advantage of the preventive care services that are covered under the Northwind Standard plan, such as annual check- ups and cleanings.\nBy taking advantage of the dental coverage offered through the Northwind Standard plan, you can be sure that you are getting the care and coverage that you need in order to maintain your oral health. If you have any questions about the coverage offered under the Northwind Standard plan, you can contact Northwind Health Customer Service for more information.\nDiagnostic X-Ray, Lab And Imaging DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY, LAB AND IMAGING\nNorthwind Standard provides coverage for diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services. This includes tests such as MRI, CT scans, x-rays, blood tests, and other lab procedures. The plan covers the cost of such services when prescribed by a doctor for a medically necessary reason.\nWhen it comes to diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services, it’s important to make sure you’re using a provider that’s in the Northwind network. If you choose a provider who is not in the network, you may be responsible for the full cost of these services. To find a provider in the network, you can use the Northwind website or call their customer service line.\nWhen receiving a diagnostic x-ray, lab, or imaging service, you will likely be responsible for paying a copayment or coinsurance. The exact amount you will be required to pay will depend on the type of service you receive. You can use the Northwind app or website to look up the cost of a particular service before you receive it.\nIn some cases, the Northwind Standard plan may exclude certain diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services. For example, the plan does not cover any services related to cosmetic treatments or procedures. Additionally, the plan does not cover any services for which no diagnosis is provided.\nIt’s important to note that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover any services related to emergency care. This includes diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services that are needed to diagnose an emergency condition. If you have an emergency condition, you will need to seek care at an emergency room or urgent care facility.\nFinally, if you receive diagnostic x-ray, lab, or imaging services from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay the full cost of the service. To ensure that you are\nreceiving services from an in-network provider, you can use the Northwind provider search tool or call the Northwind customer service line.\nBy understanding the Northwind Standard plan’s coverage for diagnostic x-ray, lab, and imaging services, you can make sure that you are receiving the best care possible while minimizing your out-of-pocket costs.\nDialysis\nCOVERED SERVICES: Dialysis\nAt Contoso, we understand that dialysis can be an expensive and necessary medical service for some of our employees. That’s why we are proud to offer coverage for dialysis treatments through Northwind Standard.\nUnder this plan, you will have coverage for in-network dialysis treatments, including both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. You will also have coverage for treatments that are necessary after or during dialysis, such as lab tests, imaging, and physical therapy.\nHowever, it is important to note that Northwind Standard does not provide coverage for any out-of-network dialysis treatments. In addition, Northwind Standard does not cover any travel expenses associated with dialysis treatments.

As part of the Northwind Standard plan, emergency room services are covered with some exceptions. To ensure that you understand the details of your coverage, it’s important to read the plan documents carefully and contact Northwind Health with any questions.\nCoverage for Emergency Room Services\nUnder the Northwind Standard plan, coverage is provided for medically necessary emergency room services. Coverage is only available when the condition is an acute medical emergency or injury, and when the emergency room is the only way to receive medical attention. For example, if you experience a broken bone, chest pain, or a head injury, you would be covered for emergency room services.\nExclusions\nHowever, there are certain services that are not covered under the Northwind Standard plan. Services that are not considered medically necessary, such as elective procedures, are not covered by the plan. In addition, services that are provided in the emergency room that are not related to the medical emergency, such as lab tests, x-rays, and other diagnostic tests, are not covered by the plan.\nTips for Utilizing Emergency Room Services\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you need to visit the emergency room, there are a few tips that can help you get the most out of your coverage. First, be sure to provide Northwind Health with all the information they need to process your claim, such as the date of service, the medical provider, and any other relevant information. Additionally, you should contact Northwind Health before you receive any services to ensure that they are covered by the plan.\nIt’s also important to remember that emergency room services can be expensive, so you should always take steps to avoid unnecessary visits. If you are feeling ill and it’s not an acute medical emergency, you should contact your primary care physician or an urgent care center before going to the emergency room. In most cases, these services are less expensive and can provide the same level of care.\nFinally, if you do need to visit the emergency room, you should be sure to keep all of your paperwork and receipts. This will help you if you need to follow up with Northwind Health about your claim.\nThe Northwind Standard plan provides coverage for emergency room services, but it’s important to understand the details of your coverage.

That’s why we provide comprehensive coverage for hearing care with Northwind Standard. You can receive hearing care services from any in-network provider and enjoy comprehensive coverage for all hearing care services.\nThe Northwind Standard plan covers all types of hearing care services, including hearing tests, hearing aids and hearing aid accessories, as well as cochlear implants and bone- anchored hearing aids. If a hearing aid or cochlear implant is needed, the plan covers up to two hearing aids or implants per ear every three years. The plan also covers routine hearing aid maintenance and repair, as well as counseling and hearing aid evaluations.\nIn addition, the Northwind Standard plan covers up to $500 per ear for hearing aid accessories, such as ear molds, batteries, and tubing. There is no deductible for hearing care services and no pre-authorization is required.\nHowever, the Northwind Standard plan does not cover hearing care services provided by out-of-network providers. If you choose to see an out-of-network provider for hearing care, you will be responsible for the difference between the out-of-network provider’s charges and the plan’s allowed amount.\nWhen it comes to choosing a hearing care provider, it’s important to find one who is qualified and experienced. Make sure to ask questions about the provider’s qualifications, experience, and specialties. You should also ask about the provider’s policies on returns, warranties, and repairs.\nIt’s also important to understand the technology behind hearing aids. Ask your provider to explain the differences between digital and analog technology, and be sure to ask about the various features that are available.\nIf you have any questions about the Northwind Standard plan’s coverage for hearing care, please contact us. We are here to help you get the most out of your benefits.\nHome Health Care\nCOVERED SERVICES: Home Health Care\nAt Northwind Health, we understand the importance of providing quality home health care for our customers.

Home health care services may include wound care, catheter care, medication management, and monitoring vital signs. In some cases, home health care services may also include occupational, speech, and respiratory therapy.\nWhen receiving home health care services, you may be required to pay a copayment or coinsurance based on the services provided and the number of visits. You may also be responsible for paying a deductible or any additional charges. However, some services, such as preventive care and certain types of home health care services, may be covered in full.\nIt is important to understand that home health care services are only covered when they are medically necessary and prescribed by a physician. Home health care services are not covered for custodial care, such as bathing and dressing, or for personal care services, such as errands and laundry.\nWhen selecting a home health care provider, it is important to make sure that the provider is in-network and is covered under the Northwind Standard Plan.

Hospice care is a specialized form of medical care that focuses on providing comfort and support to individuals with a terminal illness.\nUnder this plan, hospice care can be covered when recommended by a doctor. This care is typically provided in the patient’s home or in a hospice facility. It can include medical, social, spiritual, and emotional support for the patient and their family. Services typically included in hospice care include nursing care, medical equipment and supplies, home health aides, and prescription drugs.\nHospice care is an important part of end-of-life care. It focuses on providing comfort and support to the patient and their family, rather than trying to cure the illness.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist if there are any generic or over-the-counter options available that are covered by your insurance plan.\n4.

COVERED SERVICES: Orthognathic Surgery (Jaw Augmentation or Reduction)\nUnder Northwind Standard, orthognathic surgery, or jaw augmentation or reduction, is a type of covered service. This procedure involves the reshaping of the jaw, which may be done to correct a number of medical conditions, such as a misaligned jaw, a jaw that is too narrow or wide, an overbite, or an underbite.\nOrthognathic surgery may also be used to improve a person’s facial appearance. This type of surgery is generally performed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon and may require a hospital stay of up to three days, depending on the complexity of the procedure.\nIn order for the orthognathic surgery to be covered by Northwind Standard, the procedure must be medically necessary and the patient must be referred by a primary care physician or specialist. In addition, the patient must be an in-network provider for Northwind Standard, and the services must be performed at an in-network hospital or facility.\nWhen considering orthognathic surgery, it is important to remember that there is no one- size-fits-all approach. Each patient’s needs are different, and the procedure should be tailored to the individual’s needs. It is also important to be aware that this type of surgery may not be covered by Northwind Standard if it is considered cosmetic in nature.\nWhen seeking orthognathic surgery, it is important to discuss the risks and benefits with your primary care physician or specialist. It is also important to ask questions and seek out second opinions before making a decision. It is also a good idea to research the credentials of the surgeon you are considering, as well as the hospital or facility where the procedure will be performed.\nIn addition, it is important to remember that recovery from orthognathic surgery may take several months, and you may need to take time off from work to heal. It is also important to note that some patients may experience pain, swelling, and discomfort during the recovery period.\nFinally, it is important to remember that orthognathic surgery is a major medical procedure, and it is important to be aware of the risks and potential complications. It is also important to discuss any concerns with your primary care physician or specialist before making a decision.\nNorthwind Standard is committed to providing patients with quality care and coverage for orthognathic surgery. If you have questions about coverage or are considering this type of surgery, it is important to contact your primary care physician or specialist. You can also contact Northwind Standard for more information about coverage and eligibility.\nPrescription Drug\nCOVERED SERVICES: Prescription Drugs\nThe Northwind Standard plan provides coverage for prescription drugs. This includes both brand name and generic medications, as well as over-the-counter drugs when prescribed by a doctor. Northwind Standard also provides coverage for immunizations and vaccinations.\nIn order to receive coverage for prescription drugs, members must use one of Northwind Health’s preferred pharmacies. Preferred pharmacies offer the lowest copayments, and they also provide additional cost savings benefits. To find a preferred pharmacy in your area, you can use the Find a Pharmacy tool on the Northwind Health website.\nWhen filling a prescription, you can choose to receive your medications through the mail. This option is convenient and can help you save money. You can also request prescription refills online or by phone, and you can even use a mobile app to manage your prescriptions.\nWhen using a preferred pharmacy, you may be able to take advantage of discounts on generic medications. This can help to reduce your out-of-pocket costs.

use disorder. We encourage everyone to contact Northwind Health and speak to one of our customer service representatives if you have any questions about your coverage for substance use disorder services.\nSurgery\nSurgery\nSurgery is a common medical service and is covered under the Northwind Standard plan. You will be able to use in-network providers for your surgery, as long as it’s deemed medically necessary by your doctor.\nThe amount of coverage you receive for surgery depends on the type of surgery you need. Generally, simple and routine surgeries are covered at 100%, while major or complex surgeries may be covered at a lower rate. You can check with your insurance provider to learn more about the coverage for specific surgeries.\nBefore you receive surgery, you’ll need to get pre-authorization from your insurance provider. Pre-authorization means that your insurance provider has approved the surgery and the amount of coverage you’ll receive. If you don’t get pre-authorization, you may be responsible for all the costs of the surgery.\nYou’ll also need to make sure that you have a referral from your primary care physician if you’re seeing a specialist for surgery. If you don’t have a referral, your insurance provider may not cover the cost of the surgery.\nIf you need to stay overnight in a hospital after your surgery, your Northwind Standard plan will cover the cost of the hospital stay. However, you may have to pay a copay for each day you stay in the hospital.\nIn some cases, you may need to pay for part of the cost of the surgery. This is called coinsurance, which is a percentage of the cost that you pay out-of-pocket. The coinsurance rate for surgeries is usually around 20%, but it can vary depending on the type of surgery and the insurance provider.\nSome types of surgery are not covered by the Northwind Standard plan. These may include cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and any type of experimental surgery. You’ll need to check with your insurance provider to find out which surgeries are covered and which are not.\nWhen it comes to surgery, it’s important to plan ahead and make sure that you understand your insurance coverage. Make sure to get pre-authorization, get a referral from your primary care physician, and get an estimate of the cost of the surgery. This will help ensure that your surgery is covered and that you’re not left with unexpected costs.\nSurgical Center Care – Outpatient\nSurgical Center Care – Outpatient\nAt Northwind Health, we understand that having access to quality and affordable care is important. That’s why we offer coverage for surgical center care – outpatient services in our Northwind Standard plan.\nWhen it comes to surgical center care, Northwind Health provides coverage for procedures that require care at an outpatient surgical center. This includes surgery, as well as related services, such as lab tests, x-rays, and certain medications. This coverage is subject to certain restrictions, such as prior authorization, medical necessity, and applicable copayments or coinsurance.\nIt’s important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover services provided in a hospital outpatient department. If you need care in a hospital outpatient setting, you will need to pay the full cost of the services not covered.\nIf you need a surgical procedure, your primary care physician will likely refer you to a specialist who can provide the care you need. Make sure to ask questions and get all the information you need before you have your procedure. Also, make sure to check if the specialist is in-network with Northwind Health.

sure to contact Northwind Health beforehand. You can call our customer service team at 1-800-555-1234 and they will help you understand what services are covered by your plan and how to get the care you need.\nAt Northwind Health, we are committed to providing quality and affordable health care services. We are here to help you get the care you need, when you need it.\nTemporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMJ) Care\nCOVERED SERVICES: Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMJ) Care\nThe Northwind Standard plan includes coverage for Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMJ) Care. TMJ care is the diagnosis and management of disorders of the temporomandibular joint, which is the joint that connects the lower jaw to the skull. TMJ care can include diagnostics such as x-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and other tests or treatments, including physical therapy, medications, and surgery.\nThe Northwind Standard plan does not cover certain TMJ treatments and services, such as treatment for bruxism, TMJ splint therapy, or orthodontic treatment. Additionally, any services or treatments that are deemed to be experimental or investigational are not covered by the Northwind Standard plan.\nEmployees with this plan should be aware that they may be subject to preauthorization requirements when seeking TMJ care. Preauthorization is a process in which a health insurance company reviews the medical necessity of a treatment or procedure prior to authorizing payment. This means that the employee must obtain approval from the insurance company before receiving the treatment or procedure.\nWhen seeking TMJ care, it is important for the employee to discuss their condition and treatment options with their healthcare provider. The healthcare provider can recommend specific treatments and services that are appropriate for the employee’s condition and can help the employee understand if their treatment is covered by the Northwind Standard plan. It is also important for the employee to understand their financial responsibility prior to receiving treatment. This includes any copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles that may be applicable.\nIn addition to discussing treatment options with their healthcare provider, employees should also be proactive in managing their TMJ condition. This includes avoiding activities that can exacerbate the problem, such as grinding teeth or chewing gum, and practicing relaxation techniques to reduce stress. Additionally, employees should practice good posture and avoid sleeping on their stomach to reduce strain on the jaw. Practicing good\noral hygiene is also important, as TMJ can be caused by dental problems such as misalignment of the teeth.\nFinally, employees should be aware that TMJ is a chronic condition, which means that it may require ongoing management. Regular visits to the healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment may be necessary in order to manage the condition. Employees should also be aware that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover all TMJ treatments, so it is important to understand their financial responsibility for any treatment that is not covered.\nIn conclusion, the Northwind Standard plan does provide coverage for TMJ care, but there may be certain treatments and services that are not covered. It is important for employees to understand their financial responsibility prior to receiving treatment, and to discuss their condition and treatment options with their healthcare provider. Additionally, it is important for employees to practice good posture, avoid activities that can exacerbate the problem, and practice good oral hygiene in order to manage their TMJ condition.\nTherapeutic Injections\nTherapeutic Injections\nTherapeutic injections are a covered service under the Northwind Standard plan.

covers therapeutic injections when they are medically necessary and prescribed by a physician. Injections that are medically necessary are those that are necessary to treat, diagnose, or prevent a medical condition that has been diagnosed by a physician. This means that the injection must be part of the treatment plan for a medical condition that has been diagnosed by a physician.\nThe Northwind Standard plan does not cover injections for cosmetic purposes or for treatment of any condition that has not been diagnosed by a physician.\nIn order for a therapeutic injection to be covered by the Northwind Standard plan, the injection must be administered by a physician or other qualified healthcare provider. The injection must also be administered in a medically appropriate setting, such as a hospital or physician’s office. Injections that are administered in non-medical settings, such as a pharmacy, are not covered by the Northwind Standard plan.\nMembers of the Northwind Standard plan may be responsible for any co-payments, coinsurance, or deductibles associated with the therapeutic injection. The amount of the co- payment, coinsurance, or deductible will be determined by the member’s specific plan.\nWhen considering a therapeutic injection, members should talk to their physician or other qualified healthcare provider about the risks, benefits, and potential side effects of the injection. It is also important to discuss any other treatments or medications that may be\nnecessary in order to get the best possible outcome for the medical condition that is being treated.\nIt is also important to note that therapeutic injections may not be covered under all Northwind Standard plans. Members should check with their plan administrator to determine if a specific therapeutic injection is covered under their plan.\nWhen a therapeutic injection is covered by the Northwind Standard plan, the member should always confirm that the injection is being administered by a qualified healthcare provider in a medically appropriate setting. If a member has any questions about the therapeutic injection, they should contact the Northwind Health customer service team for more information.\nBy understanding the coverage offered by the Northwind Standard plan, members can make informed decisions about their healthcare and ensure that they are getting the best possible care.\nTransplants\nCOVERED SERVICES - Transplants\nAt Northwind Health, we understand how important it is to have access to the best possible care. That’s why our Northwind Standard plan provides coverage for organ and tissue transplants.\nIf you need a transplant of any kind, Northwind Standard will cover the expenses associated with the procedure, including the cost of the donor organ, hospital stays, recovery costs, and medications. It’s important to note that transplants are subject to certain criteria, including a determination of medical necessity, so it’s important to discuss your transplant needs with your primary care physician.\nIn addition to covering the cost of the transplant itself, Northwind Standard will also provide coverage for pre- and post-transplant care, such as laboratory tests, diagnostic tests, and other medically necessary services. It’s important to note that there are some exceptions to coverage for transplants. For example, Northwind Standard does not cover experimental or investigational transplant procedures, or any services that are not medically necessary.\nWhen it comes to making sure you get the best care possible, we believe that the best approach is to work with your doctor to determine the best course of action.

important to make sure that you are familiar with all of the details of your coverage, including any applicable copays or\ncoinsurance requirements. It’s also a good idea to ask your doctor about any potential out- of-pocket costs you may need to pay, as well as any potential alternative treatments that may be available.\nFinally, it’s important to note that Northwind Standard does not provide coverage for any experimental or investigational transplant procedures. If you’re considering a transplant procedure, it’s important to make sure that it is a medically necessary procedure, and that it is covered under your Northwind Standard plan.\nAt Northwind Health, we understand how important it is for our members to have access to the best possible care. That’s why we’re proud to provide coverage for organ and tissue transplants through our Northwind Standard plan. With this coverage, you can get the care you need, while also enjoying the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your transplant procedure is covered.\nUrgent Care # COVERED SERVICES: Urgent Care\nAt Northwind Health, our Northwind Standard plan covers urgent care services. Urgent care services are typically for medical issues that cannot wait for a scheduled appointment with a primary care provider. Examples of conditions that would be covered under urgent care include ear infections, allergic reactions, minor broken bones, and insect or animal bites.\nNorthwind Health’s Northwind Standard plan covers urgent care services provided by in- network providers. The coverage includes visits to urgent care centers and emergency rooms. It is important to note that while emergency rooms are covered, they should only be used in the event of a true medical emergency. In the case of a medical emergency, go to the nearest emergency room or call 911 right away.\nTo help you determine whether a condition requires urgent care or can wait for a scheduled appointment, Northwind Health provides access to telemedicine services. Telemedicine services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Through these services, you can talk to a doctor or nurse practitioner who can help you determine if a condition is appropriate for urgent care or should be treated with a scheduled appointment.\nWhen seeking urgent care services, it is important to keep in mind that you may be responsible for some out-of-pocket costs. This includes co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles. The amount you are responsible for will depend on your plan and the type of services you receive. To help you better understand your coverage, Northwind Health provides access to an online cost estimator tool. This tool allows you to search for specific services and get an estimate of what you will be responsible for. It is important to note that the estimates provided are only estimates, and the actual cost may vary.\nFinally, Northwind Health’s Northwind Standard plan does not cover services that are not medically necessary. Examples of services that are not covered include cosmetic procedures\nand elective treatments. Additionally, the plan does not cover services that are not related to the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury.\nAt Northwind Health, we are committed to helping you get the care you need when you need it. We understand that medical issues can arise suddenly and can be unpredictable. That is why we offer coverage for urgent care services through our Northwind Standard plan. If you have any questions about your coverage, please contact our customer service team.\nVirtual Care COVERED SERVICES: VIRTUAL CARE\nAt Northwind Health, we understand that our members may have difficulty accessing in- person care.

can help you to stay accountable and motivated.\nBy following these tips and taking advantage of the coverage available through Northwind Standard, you can take steps towards managing your weight and improving your overall health.\nWHAT DO I DO IF I'M OUTSIDE WASHINGTON?\nOut-Of-Area Care\nWHAT DO I DO IF I'M OUTSIDE WASHINGTON?\nIf you find yourself outside of Washington and in need of medical care, Northwind Standard provides coverage for out-of-area emergency services. You will be covered for medically necessary services and supplies to treat a sudden and unexpected illness or injury. You are also covered for emergency services related to a pre-existing condition.\nIt is important to know that Northwind Standard does not provide coverage for non- emergency services outside of Washington. That means you may be responsible for the full cost of care if you seek out care for a condition that could have been treated in Washington.\nIn order to receive coverage for out-of-area care, you must meet the following criteria:\n• You must be outside of Washington for no more than 12 consecutive months\n• You must be more than 100 miles away from your primary care provider\n• Your plan must have been in effect for at least 6 months before you receive out-of-area care\nIf you meet the criteria listed above, you may be eligible for coverage of out-of-area services. In order to receive coverage, you must contact Northwind Health in advance of receiving care. You must also obtain prior authorization for any care you wish to receive. If prior authorization is not obtained, you may be responsible for the full cost of care.\nIf you are outside of Washington for more than 12 consecutive months, you may not be eligible for coverage of out-of-area services. In this case, you may need to seek out a new plan that offers coverage in the state where you are living.\nIt is important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover out-of-network services outside of Washington. This means that you will need to find in-network providers in the state where you are living to receive coverage.\nIt is also important to keep in mind that the cost of care can vary widely outside of Washington. You should contact Northwind Health to get an estimate of the cost of care for services you may need. This can help you make an informed decision about where to obtain care.\nFinally, it is important to keep your Northwind Standard plan active while you are out of state. This will ensure that you remain eligible for coverage if you need to receive out-of- area care.\nBy following the tips outlined above, you can ensure that you are prepared if you find yourself needing care outside of Washington. Northwind Standard provides coverage for out-of-area emergency services, but it does not provide coverage for non-emergency services, out-of-network services, or care received outside of Washington for more than 12 consecutive months. Prior authorization must also be obtained in order to receive coverage. Keeping your plan active while out of state will also ensure that you remain eligible for coverage.\nCARE MANAGEMENT\nPrior-Authorization\nCARE MANAGEMENT: Prior Authorization\nNorthwind Standard includes Care Management services, which are designed to provide support, information, and proactive care for members. Specifically, this plan includes a Prior Authorization (PA) process for certain services.\nPrior Authorization is a process used by Northwind Health to make sure that a covered service is medically necessary and is the most cost-effective way to receive the service. Before certain services are approved and covered, an authorization must be requested from Northwind Health.

With prior\nauthorization, services must be approved by Northwind Health before you can receive them. This process helps ensure that members receive the right care at the right time.\nThere are certain services that require prior authorization before the service is rendered. These services can include, but are not limited to, hospital stays, certain laboratory tests, certain imaging services, physical therapy, and durable medical equipment. Northwind Health may also require prior authorization for drugs that are not on the Northwind Standard formulary.\nWhen you or your doctor request a service that requires prior authorization, Northwind Health will review the request. Northwind Health will then decide if the service is medically necessary and covered under Northwind Standard. Northwind Health will notify you and your doctor of the decision within three business days.\nIf Northwind Health approves the service, you may receive the service without any additional pre-authorization. However, if Northwind Health denies coverage, you may be able to appeal the decision. You can contact Northwind Health by phone or mail to submit an appeal.\nNorthwind Health may also review claims after the services have been provided. This process is called retrospective review and is used to ensure that the services provided were medically necessary and appropriate. Northwind Health may also use this process to detect fraud and abuse.\nWhen requesting prior authorization, it is important to provide Northwind Health with all the necessary information. This includes a complete medical history and diagnosis, as well as any other relevant information.

necessary information before the requested service is provided. If Northwind Health does not receive all the necessary information, the prior authorization request may be denied.\nWhen requesting prior authorization, it is also important to check with your doctor to make sure the service is covered under Northwind Standard. Some services may not be covered, even if prior authorization is approved.\nFinally, if the service is approved, make sure to keep a copy of the authorization. This will help ensure that you receive the coverage you are entitled to.\nPrior authorization can be a complicated process. However, it is important to remember that it is in place to help ensure that members receive the right care at the right time. Northwind Health is committed to helping members make informed decisions about their health care.\nPrior-Authorization for Benefit Coverage CARE MANAGEMENT: Prior-Authorization for Benefit Coverage\nAt Northwind Health, Contoso's employees have access to a variety of healthcare benefits, including coverage for medical, vision, and dental services. With Northwind Standard, employees can also choose from a variety of in-network providers for their care. However, in order to get the most out of their benefit coverage, employees should be aware of the prior-authorization process for certain services and treatments.\nPrior-authorization is a process in which Northwind Health requires Contoso's employees to get approval from their plan before receiving certain services or treatments. This process helps ensure that the care is necessary and medically appropriate. If prior-authorization is not obtained, the employee may be responsible for the full cost of any services or treatments that are received without approval.\nSome services or treatments that may require prior-authorization include, but are not limited to, hospital stays, certain medical procedures, durable medical equipment, and certain prescription drugs. In order to obtain prior-authorization, the employee's physician must submit a request to Northwind Health. The request will then be reviewed by Northwind Health to determine if the service or treatment is medically necessary and if it is a covered benefit under the Northwind Standard plan.\nIn some cases, Northwind Health may also require that the employee meet certain criteria in order to be approved for a service or treatment. These criteria may include specific medical tests or treatments, lifestyle changes, or other requirements. If the employee is unable to meet the criteria, prior-authorization may not be granted.\nThere are some exceptions to the prior-authorization process. For example, preventive care services and emergency services are not subject to prior-authorization. In addition, mental health and substance abuse coverage is not subject to prior-authorization. However, out-of- network services are subject to prior-authorization and may require additional cost to the employee.\nHere are some tips for Contoso's employees to help them navigate the prior-authorization process:\n• Contact your physician's office to determine if prior-authorization is required before receiving a service or treatment.\n• Contact Northwind Health to determine if a service or treatment is a covered benefit under Northwind Standard.\n• Ask your physician to submit a request for prior-authorization as soon as possible.\n• Understand the criteria that may be required for prior-authorization and be prepared to meet those criteria if necessary.\n• Be aware of any exceptions to the prior-authorization process, such as preventive care and emergency services.\nBy understanding the prior-authorization process and following these tips, Contoso's employees can ensure that they get the most out of their benefit coverage.\nExceptions To Prior Authorization For Benefit Coverage\nCARE MANAGEMENT: Exceptions To Prior Authorization For Benefit Coverage\nAt Northwind Health, we understand the importance of providing quality care for our members.

We understand that there are circumstances when the care needed is not available through an in-network provider, and so we make exceptions to the prior-authorization requirement.\nFirst and foremost, it's important to note that prior authorization is not required for emergency services. If you find yourself in an emergency situation, you can immediately seek out the care you need without worrying about getting prior authorization.\nIn addition, prior authorization is not necessary for emergency services provided in a foreign country. This includes both medical and dental services. However, it's important to\nremember that Northwind Standard does not cover out-of-network services in foreign countries.\nIn rare cases, prior authorization may also be waived for services that are not available in- network.

be responsible for any costs associated with out-of-network services.\nIn order to ensure that you are receiving the best care possible, it's important to understand the basics of prior authorization. Prior authorization is a process in which your insurance company reviews the request and verifies the need for the service or procedure. This helps to ensure that you receive the appropriate care and that the costs associated with the care are covered by your plan.\nIf you're considering seeking care from an out-of-network provider, it's important to remember that prior authorization is required for out-of-network services. You should call Northwind Health to obtain prior authorization before you receive care from an out-of- network provider.\nIt's also important to know that prior authorization may be denied if the service or procedure is not medically necessary or not covered under your plan. If prior authorization is denied, you may be responsible for any costs associated with the care.\nAt Northwind Health, we understand that there are times when care is not available through an in-network provider. That's why we make exceptions to the prior-authorization requirement for certain services and procedures. However, it's important to remember that prior authorization is still required for most out-of-network services.\nIf you have any questions about prior authorization for out-of-network providers, please contact Northwind Health. We're here to help you get the care you need, and we're here to help you understand the process of prior authorization.\nClinical Review\nCARE MANAGEMENT: Clinical Review\nThe Northwind Standard plan offers a variety of care management services to help ensure that members receive quality, cost-effective care. These services include clinical review, which is a process that evaluates the medical necessity and appropriateness of a proposed course of treatment, as well as any adjustment or changes to existing treatments.\nClinical review is conducted by Northwind Health’s Medical Management Department, which is staffed by licensed clinicians who are experienced in the various medical conditions and treatments that are covered by the Northwind Standard plan. These clinicians use evidence-based guidelines and other important criteria to evaluate the proposed course of treatment and make sure that it is medically necessary and appropriate.\nNorthwind Health utilizes a three-level clinical review process. The first level of review involves a Registered Nurse (RN) or Medical Doctor (MD) evaluating the proposed course of treatment. If the RN or MD determines that the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary, then the case is approved and the member can proceed with the treatment. If the RN or MD determines that the proposed course of treatment is not medically necessary, then the case is referred to the next level of review.\nAt the second level of review, the case is evaluated by a Medical Director, who is an MD or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). The Medical Director reviews the case and makes a final determination as to whether the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary or not. If the Medical Director approves the case, then the member can proceed with the treatment. If the Medical Director does not approve the case, then the case is referred to the third level of review.\nAt the third and final level of review, the case is evaluated by a Medical Review Officer, who is an MD or DO. The Medical Review Officer reviews the case and makes a final determination as to whether the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary or not. If the Medical Review Officer approves the case, then the member can proceed with the treatment.

Coordinating benefits allows you to receive payments from each health plan towards covered services, as long as the total amount of payments does not exceed the total charges for the service.\nIf you have other coverage, such as Medicare or an employer-sponsored health plan, the Northwind Standard plan may be able to coordinate benefits with those plans. This can help reduce your out-of-pocket costs for health care services.\nHow Do I Coordinate Benefits with Other Plans?\nIf you have other health care coverage, you should contact the other health care plan(s) to determine how to coordinate benefits. Depending on the plans you have, you may be able to coordinate benefits by filing a claim with both plans.\nYou will need to provide the other plan with a copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the Northwind Health plan. The EOB is a summary of the services you received and how much the Northwind Health plan paid for those services.\nWhen filing a claim with the other health care plan, you may also need to provide a copy of your bill or invoice. The other plan may require additional information as part of the claim process.\nYou should keep copies of all documentation that you submit to the other plan. This can help you track your claim and follow up with the other plan if there are any delays in processing.\nExceptions\nCoordination of benefits with other plans is not available for all types of services.

documentation you need to provide.\n• Keep copies of all documentation you submit to the other plan, including bills and invoices.\n• Follow up with the other plan if there are any delays in

comes to their health care coverage. COB is a system used to determine which health plan pays first when an employee has more than one health plan.\nWhen an employee has multiple health plans, the health plan that pays first is determined by the order of benefit determination. Generally, the employee's primary health plan pays\nfirst, followed by the secondary health plan. However, if one of the health plans is a Medicare or Medicaid plan, that plan pays first.\nUnder the Northwind Standard Plan, if you have other coverage, you may be able to use the network providers and services that are covered by Northwind Standard at a lower cost. However, the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the Northwind Standard network will not be covered by the plan.\nWhen you receive health care services, it's important to identify all of your coverage to the provider to ensure that they bill each health plan appropriately. This helps to ensure that you receive the full benefits offered by each plan. If you do not identify all of your health coverage, it may result in a delay of payment or denial of coverage.\nWhen you submit a claim to Northwind Standard, you'll need to include information about the other coverage you have. If the claim is sent to Northwind Standard before any other plan, the claim will be processed based on the Northwind Standard plan benefits.\nIt's important to remember that Northwind Standard does not coordinate benefits with other coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will not adjust the amount of payment made to a provider to take into account payments from other coverage. If a provider has been paid by another plan, you are still responsible for the balance due after Northwind Standard pays its portion of the claim.\nIf you have other coverage, it's important to review the benefits of each plan to make sure you are taking full advantage of your coverage. If you need help understanding your plan benefits or have any questions about the coordination of benefits, please contact the Northwind Standard Plan Customer Service team. We're here to help!\nPrimary And Secondary Rules\nWHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?\nIf you have other health coverage, such as coverage through a spouse’s plan, Northwind Standard may become your secondary coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will pay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays.\nThe primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to understand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and the secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying the largest portion of your healthcare costs.\nFor example, if you have a spouse’s health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse’s plan would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This means that your spouse’s plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs.\nIt’s important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not covered by the primary plan.

to the primary and secondary rules. For instance, if you have Medicare coverage, it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind Standard will be the secondary coverage. However, if you have Medicare Part D for prescription drugs, Northwind Standard will be the primary coverage and Medicare Part D will be the secondary coverage.\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage, you may need to provide evidence of that coverage to your health plan. This is known as “creditable coverage,” and it helps to ensure that Northwind Standard will pay any eligible expenses once the primary plan has paid.\nWhen it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules, it’s important to remember that each health plan is different. Be sure to review your plan documents to understand the specific rules and restrictions that apply to your coverage.\nFinally, if you have any questions or concerns about your coverage, be sure to reach out to Northwind Health. Their knowledgeable customer service representatives are always available to answer your questions and provide guidance on how best to use your coverage.\nCOB's Effect On Benefits\nWHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?\nWhen you have other health insurance coverage, coordination of benefits (COB) can affect how your benefits are paid. COB is a process where your insurance companies coordinate who pays first when you have multiple health insurance plans that cover the same medical expenses. The insurance company that pays first is called the primary payer, and the company that pays second is called the secondary payer.\nCoordination of Benefits Exceptions\nThere are a few exceptions to COB rules that may apply to you. If you are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or a veterans’ health plan, Northwind Standard may pay first, even if the other plan is usually the primary payer. Additionally, if you are enrolled in a plan that is required by law to coordinate benefits, such as an employer-sponsored plan, Northwind Standard may pay first.\nUnderstanding How COB Affects Your Benefits\nWhen COB applies, the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible expenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost. Depending on the type of service, the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses. When this happens, the secondary payer may pay nothing.\nFor example, if you receive a medical bill for $1,000 and the primary payer pays $800, the secondary payer will pay the remaining balance of $200. However, if the primary payer pays the full $1,000, the secondary payer will not pay anything.\nTips for Working with COB\nWhen you have multiple health insurance plans, it’s important to understand how COB works and how it can affect your benefits. Here are a few tips to help you manage your benefits:\n• Make sure that each insurance company has all of the necessary information about your other coverage, including plan numbers and policy dates.\n• Confirm that your primary and secondary payers have updated information about each other.\n• Ask your health care providers to submit claims to both insurance companies.\n• Understand any limitations or exclusions that may apply to your benefits.\n• If you have questions, contact each insurance company for clarification.\nOverall, it’s important to understand how COB works and how it affects your benefits. By being aware of the rules and exceptions, you can ensure that you are getting the full coverage you need from both insurance companies.\nSubrogation And Reimbursement Subrogation And Reimbursement\nWhen you have other health coverage, such as Medicare or another employer’s health plan, Northwind Standard may still provide coverage in certain circumstances. This is called “subrogation and reimbursement.” Subrogation and reimbursement works when another health plan pays for a service that is covered by Northwind Standard.

file a claim with Northwind Health. Third, if you are ever injured in an accident, make sure to seek medical attention as soon as possible.\nFinally, make sure to keep your policy up to date. As life changes, so do your needs, and it’s important to make sure that your coverage is enough to protect you in the event of an accident. By taking the time to review your policy and make sure that you have the right coverage, you can be sure that you have the protection you need.\nHOW DO I FILE A CLAIM?\nTimely Filing\nHOW DO I FILE A CLAIM?\nTimely Filing\nAt Northwind Health, timely filing is important to ensure that your claims are processed correctly and in a timely manner. All claims must be filed within twelve months of the date of service, otherwise the claims may be denied. Claims submitted after the twelve month window may be reviewed for consideration of payment, however, no guarantee is made that the claims will be accepted.\nIf you are a Northwind Standard member, you may be able to file a claim directly through the Northwind website or app. If you're filing a claim on behalf of a family member, make sure that you have their authorization to do so.\nIt's important to also keep in mind that some services are subject to pre-approval from Northwind Health, and your provider may need to submit a request prior to the service being performed. This includes services such as MRI/CT scans, physical therapy, and other specialty services. If you are unsure whether your provider requires pre-approval for a service, you should contact Northwind Health prior to the service being performed.\nThere are a few exceptions to the twelve month timely filing limit. These include claims submitted for newborns, claims submitted for a deceased member, and claims submitted for\nservices that were provided out-of-country. In these situations, claims may be submitted up to 24 months after the date of service.\nIt's also important to remember that when filing a claim, you should make sure to include all necessary documentation. This includes itemized bills, a completed claim form, and any other documentation that is requested by Northwind Health. If any of these items are missing, your claim may be delayed or denied.\nTo ensure timely filing, it's important to keep track of the dates of service for all services you receive. You should also keep copies of all documentation related to your services, and if you're unsure of the filing requirements, you should contact Northwind Health for clarification.\nOverall, timely filing is an important part of the claim filing process. By following the guidelines for timely filing and including all necessary documentation with your claims, you can help ensure that your claims are processed quickly and accurately.\nCOMPLAINTS AND APPEALS\nWhat You Can Appeal COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS\nWhat You Can Appeal\nWhen you have Northwind Standard coverage, you have the right to appeal any denial of services or payment of benefits. This includes if you disagree with the amount of the payment or if you feel that your claim was denied incorrectly. You also have the right to appeal if you feel that an authorization was not provided for a service, or if you believe that a service should be covered by your plan but was not.\nIf you believe that your claim was wrongly denied or that you have a dispute over a service that is covered or not covered, you have the right to file a formal appeal. It is important to note that the appeals process is different than filing a complaint. A complaint is an informal way of expressing your dissatisfaction with a service or policy, and does not include a formal review of your claim.\nYou can file an appeal by submitting a letter or appeal form to Northwind Health.

If you disagree with a decision made by your plan, you have the right to submit an appeal. Appealing a decision can help ensure that you get the care you need.\nWhat Is An Appeal?\nAn appeal is a written request for your plan to reconsider a decision. This could include decisions about coverage for a service, the amount paid for a service, or a denial of a service. You can also appeal if you feel that your plan hasn’t provided the services that it agreed to provide.\nWhen Can I Submit An Appeal?\nYou can submit an appeal if you have received a written denial of coverage or payment. You should receive a written notice from your plan that explains the denial and provides you with instructions on how to file an appeal. If you do not receive a notice, contact your plan for more information.\nWhat Is The Deadline For Submitting An Appeal?\nYou must submit an appeal within 180 days of the date of your notice of denial. If you don’t submit the appeal within this time frame, your appeal may be denied.\nHow Do I Submit An Appeal?\nYou can submit an appeal by mail, fax, or email. You should include the following information in your appeal:\n• Your name and address\n• Your plan ID number\n• The date of the denial notice\n• A copy of the denial notice\n• A detailed explanation of why you disagree with the decision\n• Any additional information to support your appeal\n• Your signature\nExceptions\nIf you need an expedited appeal, you can contact your plan to discuss this option. If you need an expedited appeal due to an urgent medical condition, your plan must respond within 24 hours.\nTips\n• Make sure to include all of the necessary information in your appeal.\n• Keep a copy of your appeal for your records.\n• Don’t hesitate to contact your plan if you need assistance with the appeal process.\n• Follow up with your plan if you don’t receive a response to your appeal within a reasonable amount of time.\n• Consider hiring a lawyer if you need help with your appeal.\nOnce The IRO Decides\nOnce The IRO Decides\nThe Independent Review Organization (IRO) is a third-party organization that reviews appeals and complaints about healthcare services that have been denied coverage under the Northwind Standard plan. If an employee is not satisfied with the decision made by Northwind Health, they can submit a written complaint or request an appeal by filing a formal grievance.\nWhat Happens After The IRO Decides?\nOnce the IRO has completed its review, it will issue a formal decision either upholding the original decision or reversing it. The decision made by the IRO is considered final and binding.\nExceptions\nThere are some exceptions to the IRO decision that could be applicable to your case. If the IRO determines that the decision was the result of a misapplication of plan provisions or incorrect information, the decision can be reversed. Additionally, if the IRO finds that the decision was not made in accordance with the terms of the plan, the decision can be reversed.\nTips For Employees\nIf you are not satisfied with the decision

You should also make sure that you understand any restrictions that may apply to the services you receive. Be sure to check with your provider to make sure that they accept the Northwind Standard plan.

These independent contractors provide services that are covered under the plan, such as primary care physician visits, specialty care services, and other healthcare services. Depending on the plan, these independent contractors may also provide services such as mental health and substance abuse counseling, physical therapy, and home health services.\nIt is important for employees to understand that Northwind Standard does not provide coverage for care received from independent contractors. Employees must pay for these services out-of-pocket, and any claims for services provided by independent contractors must be submitted directly to the provider.\nWhen seeking care from an independent contractor, it is important for employees to make sure they are aware of any additional fees or restrictions that may apply. For example, some providers may require a fee for services such as mental health counseling, or may only accept certain types of insurance. It is also important for employees to understand that the provider may not be able to provide care if the employee does not have the required documentation or is unable to pay the required fee.\nIn addition, it is important for employees to understand that independent contractors may not be subject to the same regulations as other healthcare providers. For example, the provider may not be required to adhere to the same quality standards as other healthcare providers, and may not be required to be licensed in the state where the services are provided.\nWhen selecting a provider, it is important for employees to make sure they are familiar with the provider’s policies and procedures. Employees should also make sure they understand any additional costs that may be associated with the services provided by the independent contractor.\nFinally, when selecting a provider, it is important for employees to research the provider’s background and credentials. Employees should make sure the provider is properly licensed and certified, and has a good reputation in the healthcare community. Additionally, employees should make sure the provider is up-to-date on the latest advances in healthcare technology and treatments, so they can be sure they are receiving the best possible care.\nOverall, when selecting a healthcare provider, it is important for employees to do their research and make sure they understand the provider’s policies and procedures, as well as any additional costs that may be associated with the services they provide. Additionally, it is important for employees to make sure the provider is properly licensed and certified, and has a good reputation in the healthcare community.

there are unfortunately many companies who make intentionally false or misleading statements about their plans. Northwind Health is no exception. It is important for employees to be aware of any potential inaccuracies or false information that Northwind Health may use when discussing their plans.\nFirst and foremost, it is important to remember that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of- network services. The Northwind Standard plan provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental services, but does not cover any of the services mentioned. While Northwind Health may advertise that their plan covers these services, it is important to be aware that they do not.\nNorthwind Health may also make claims that their plan covers any type of preventive care services. While Northwind Standard does cover some preventive care services, it is important to remember that they may not cover all preventive care services. It is important to read the plan details in order to determine which preventive care services are covered.\nIt is also important to be aware that Northwind Health may make claims that their network of in-network providers is comprehensive. While Northwind Standard does offer a variety of in-network providers, it is important to remember that the network of in-network providers may not be as comprehensive as Northwind Health claims. It is important to research the providers and services offered in the Northwind Standard plan in order to determine if the providers and services offered are sufficient for the employee's needs.\nIn addition, Northwind Health may make claims that their plan offers low or no cost prescription drugs. While Northwind Standard does offer a prescription drug coverage, it is important to remember that the plan does not necessarily offer low or no cost prescription drugs. It is important to read the plan details to determine which prescription drugs are covered and what the associated costs are.\nFinally, Northwind Health may make claims that their plan is the best plan available. While Northwind Standard may be a good plan, it is important to remember that there may be other plans that are better suited to the employee's needs. It is important to research other plans and compare them to Northwind Standard in order to determine which plan is the best option.\nTips for Avoiding Intentionally False Or Misleading Statements:\nWhen it comes to understanding a health plan, it is important to be aware of any intentionally false or misleading statements that the plan provider may make. To avoid being misled, employees should follow the following tips:\n1. Read the plan details carefully. It is important to understand the details of the health plan in order to make sure that the plan fits the employee's needs.\n2. Ask questions. If the employee is unsure about any part of the plan, it is important to ask questions in order to make sure that the plan is suitable for their needs.\n3. Research other plans. It is important to research other plans and compare them to Northwind Standard in order to determine which plan is the best option.\n4. Verify the information. If the employee is unsure about the accuracy of any information that Northwind Health provides, it is important to verify the information with a trusted source.\nBy following these tips, employees can make sure that they are not misled by Northwind Health's intentionally false or misleading statements.

This could include coverage from your spouse’s or a parent’s employer, or from a government-sponsored program such as Medicare or Medicaid.\nIf you and your spouse have coverage under different plans, you must determine which plan is the primary plan and which is secondary. This is important, as the primary plan will pay first; the secondary plan will pay what the primary plan does not.\nIf you have other coverage, you must notify Northwind Health of any changes in your coverage status or any changes in any of your other coverage. If you fail to do so, you may be responsible for any charges that Northwind Health would have paid if you had notified them of the other coverage.\nIn certain circumstances, you may be able to keep your other coverage and still be eligible for coverage under the Northwind Standard plan. However, if the other coverage is primary, you will be responsible for any charges that would have been paid by the Northwind Standard plan.\nIt is also important to note that if you have coverage through a government-sponsored program such as Medicare or Medicaid, you may be subject to certain restrictions. For example, you may be required to obtain certain services through the government- sponsored plan.\nTips for Employees\nTo ensure you get the most out of your Northwind Standard coverage, here are

The claim cannot be resolved in any other state or country.\nTips\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind when filing a claim with Northwind Health:\n• Always keep the location of the service in mind when filing a claim.\n• Make sure to include the appropriate state or country on the claim form.\n• Always provide detailed information about the services that were rendered, including the date, time, and location.\n• Make sure to include any relevant medical records or other documentation with the claim.\n• When possible, make sure to file the claim in the same state or county where the services were rendered.\n• In cases where the services were rendered in multiple states or counties, make sure to file the claim in the state or county where the majority of the services were rendered.\n• Disputes concerning the claim must be resolved in the state where the claim was filed, according to the state’s laws.\n• If the services were rendered outside of the United States, make sure to file the claim in the state or country in which the services were rendered.\nWomen's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN: Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998\nThe Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA) is a federal law that provides rights and protections to people receiving mastectomies, a surgery to remove all or part of the breast. Under this law, health plans, including Northwind Standard, must provide coverage for mastectomies, reconstructive surgery, and other related medical services that are required by the attending physician in connection with a mastectomy.\nThe WHCRA applies to all group health plans, including Northwind Standard, and health insurance issuers that offer group health plans.

complications of the mastectomy.\nNot all mastectomies will qualify for WHCRA coverage. For example, mastectomies that are done for cosmetic reasons or for the treatment of a non-invasive breast cancer (i.e. Ductal Carcinoma in situ) are not covered under WHCRA.\nIn order for the coverage to be effective, the attending physician must provide written certification that the mastectomy was medically necessary. The certification should include a description of the medical condition, the type of mastectomy performed, and the type of reconstructive surgery required. The attending physician must also certify that the mastectomy was performed for medical reasons and not for reasons of cosmetic enhancement.\nWhen the attending physician provides the written certification, the plan must provide coverage for the mastectomy and any reconstructive surgery that is required. The coverage must include all stages of reconstruction, prostheses, and other supplies related to the reconstruction. The plan must also provide coverage for physical complications of the mastectomy, including lymphedema, which is a condition that causes swelling due to a buildup of lymph fluid in the affected area.\nIn addition, the plan must provide coverage for outpatient services, such as physical therapy and counseling, that are related to the mastectomy or reconstructive surgery. The plan must also provide coverage for ancillary services that are related to the mastectomy or reconstructive surgery, such as ambulance services, durable medical equipment, and prosthetic devices.\nUnder the WHCRA, the coverage must be provided without imposing any additional costs or restrictions on the patient. This means that the patient should not have to pay any additional coinsurance, copayment, or deductible for the mastectomy or reconstructive surgery.\nThe WHCRA also provides rights for women who have already had mastectomies. If a woman has already had a mastectomy and the plan does not cover reconstructive surgery or medically related services, the plan must provide coverage for those services if the attending physician certifies that the services are medically necessary.\nFinally, the WHCRA provides certain rights for women who are considering having a mastectomy. In particular, the law requires that all group health plans provide a written notice to women about the coverage that is available under the plan for mastectomies and reconstructive surgery. This notice must be provided at the time of enrollment in the plan and at least annually thereafter.\nThe WHCRA provides important rights and protections to women who have had, or are considering having, a mastectomy. It is important for employees to understand their rights and to make sure that their health plan is providing the coverage that is required by the law.\nWorkers’ Compensation Insurance\nOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN: Workers' Compensation Insurance\nAt Contoso, we are committed to providing our employees with a safe and productive work environment.
